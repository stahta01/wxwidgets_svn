This sample tests regular expressions,
using a selection of libraries.

USAGE:

1.
Enter the regular expression pattern in
the Regular Expression field

2.
Enter the string you want to match against
in the String to Search field

3.  
The Iterations field is the number of times
the match will be executed (if successful)
when performing the Match Time speed test.

4.
Select your options from the Options menu -
Most of them are documented in the wxRegEx
class docs in wxWindows.

Test Compile - Adds compile to the match time
speed test (i.e. it compiles and matches 
the number of times that are specified 
in the iterations field, otherwise
it just matches).
