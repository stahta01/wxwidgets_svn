TODO
=====================================================================


- typedef wxCoords CoordType ??

- merge RecalulateXXX and Layout() into one
- remove UpdateCursorScreenCoords() which is no longer needed

  - UNDO!!
  - replacement of llist in window
  - selection highlighting is a bit broken
Improve speed! (See layout problem below!)

  - wxlwindow needs to shrink scrollbar range when window contents get removed
  - When selecting with the mouse, scroll window if pointer is outside.



- The import of a private data object does not work yet, we need to get
  the objects back from the string.
- Changing default settings in Clear() or changing/inserting/deleting
  a wxLayoutObject needs to update the m_StyleInfo in all lines, only
  then can we start using that one.
  
- update rectangle (needs support in wxllist and wxWindows)
  --> needs a bit of fixing still
      some code bits are commented out in wxlwindow.cpp
      offset handling seems a bit dodgy, white shadow to top/left of cursor

  - DragNDrop

  - Update docs, do full rtf/html editing. 
  - Verify html export.
