    @class wxCondition
    @wxheader{thread.h}

    wxCondition variables correspond to pthread conditions or to Win32 event
    objects. They may be used in a multithreaded application to wait until the
    given condition becomes @true which happens when the condition becomes signaled.

    For example, if a worker thread is doing some long task and another thread has
    to wait until it is finished, the latter thread will wait on the condition
    object and the worker thread will signal it on exit (this example is not
    perfect because in this particular case it would be much better to just
    wxThread::Wait for the worker thread, but if there are several
    worker threads it already makes much more sense).

    Note that a call to wxCondition::Signal may happen before the
    other thread calls wxCondition::Wait and, just as with the
    pthread conditions, the signal is then lost and so if you want to be sure that
    you don't miss it you must keep the mutex associated with the condition
    initially locked and lock it again before calling
    wxCondition::Signal. Of course, this means that this call is
    going to block until wxCondition::Wait is called by another
    thread.

    @class wxCriticalSectionLocker
    @wxheader{thread.h}

    This is a small helper class to be used with wxCriticalSection
    objects. A wxCriticalSectionLocker enters the critical section in the
    constructor and leaves it in the destructor making it much more difficult to
    forget to leave a critical section (which, in general, will lead to serious
    and difficult to debug problems).

    Example of using it:

    @code
    void Set Foo()
    {
        // gs_critSect is some (global) critical section guarding access to the
        // object "foo"
        wxCriticalSectionLocker locker(gs_critSect);

        if ( ... )
        {
            // do something
            ...

            return;
        }

        // do something else
        ...

        return;
    }
    @endcode

    Without wxCriticalSectionLocker, you would need to remember to manually leave
    the critical section before each @c return.

/**
    @class wxThreadHelper
    @wxheader{thread.h}

    The wxThreadHelper class is a mix-in class that manages a single background
    thread.  By deriving from wxThreadHelper, a class can implement the thread
    code in its own wxThreadHelper::Entry method
    and easily share data and synchronization objects between the main thread
    and the worker thread.  Doing this prevents the awkward passing of pointers
    that is needed when the original object in the main thread needs to
    synchronize with its worker thread in its own wxThread derived object.

    For example, wxFrame may need to make some calculations
    in a background thread and then display the results of those calculations in
    the main window.

    Ordinarily, a wxThread derived object would be created
    with the calculation code implemented in
    wxThread::Entry.  To access the inputs to the
    calculation, the frame object would often to pass a pointer to itself to the
    thread object.  Similarly, the frame object would hold a pointer to the
    thread object.  Shared data and synchronization objects could be stored in
    either object though the object without the data would have to access the
    data through a pointer.

    However, with wxThreadHelper, the frame object and the thread object are
    treated as the same object.  Shared data and synchronization variables are
    stored in the single object, eliminating a layer of indirection and the
    associated pointers.

    @class wxCriticalSection
    @wxheader{thread.h}

    A critical section object is used for exactly the same purpose as
    mutexes(). The only difference is that under Windows platform
    critical sections are only visible inside one process, while mutexes may be
    shared among processes, so using critical sections is slightly more
    efficient. The terminology is also slightly different: mutex may be locked (or
    acquired) and unlocked (or released) while critical section is entered and left
    by the program.

/**
    @class wxThread
    @wxheader{thread.h}

    A thread is basically a path of execution through a program. Threads are
    sometimes called @e light-weight processes, but the fundamental difference
    between threads and processes is that memory spaces of different processes are
    separated while all threads share the same address space.

    While it makes it much easier to share common data between several threads, it
    also makes it much easier to shoot oneself in the foot, so careful use of
    synchronization objects such as mutexes() or @ref wxCriticalSection
    "critical sections" is recommended. In addition, don't create global thread
    objects because they allocate memory in their constructor, which will cause
    problems for the memory checking system.

    @section overview_typeswxthread Types of wxThreads
        There are two types of threads in wxWidgets: @e detached and @e joinable,
        modeled after the the POSIX thread API. This is different from the Win32 API
        where all threads are joinable.
        
        By default wxThreads in wxWidgets use the detached behavior. Detached threads
        delete themselves once they have completed, either by themselves when they
        complete processing or through a call to Delete(), and thus
        must be created on the heap (through the new operator, for example).
        Conversely, joinable threads do not delete themselves when they are done 
        processing and as such are safe to create on the stack. Joinable threads
        also provide the ability for one to get value it returned from Entry()
        through Wait().
        
        You shouldn't hurry to create all the threads joinable, however, because this
        has a disadvantage as well: you @b must Wait() for a joinable thread or the
        system resources used by it will never be freed, and you also must delete the
        corresponding wxThread object yourself if you did not create it on the stack.
        In contrast, detached threads are of the "fire-and-forget" kind: you only have to
        start a detached thread and it will terminate and destroy itself.
    @section overview_deletionwxthread wxThread Deletion
        Regardless of whether it has terminated or not, you should call
        Wait() on a joinable thread to release its memory, as outlined in 
        @ref overview_typeswxthread "Types of wxThreads". If you created
        a joinable thread on the heap, remember to delete it manually with the delete
        operator or similar means as only detached threads handle this type of memory
        management.
        
        Since detached threads delete themselves when they are finished processing,
        you should take care when calling a routine on one. If you are certain the
        thread is still running and would like to end it, you may call Delete() 
        to gracefully end it (which implies that the thread will be deleted after 
        that call to Delete()). It should be implied that you should never attempt
        to delete a detached thread with the delete operator or similar means.
        As mentioned, Wait() or Delete() attempts to gracefully terminate a 
        joinable and detached thread, respectively. It does this by waiting until
        the thread in question calls TestDestroy() or ends processing (returns 
        from wxThread::Entry).
        
        Obviously, if the thread does call TestDestroy() and does not end the calling
        thread will come to halt. This is why it is important to call TestDestroy() in
        the Entry() routine of your threads as often as possible.
        As a last resort you can end the thread immediately through Kill(). It is
        strongly recommended that you do not do this, however, as it does not free
        the resources associated with the object (although the wxThread object of
        detached threads will still be deleted) and could leave the C runtime 
        library in an undefined state.
    @section overview_secondarythreads wxWidgets Calls in Secondary Threads
        All threads other than the "main application thread" (the one
        wxApp::OnInit or your main function runs in, for example) are considered
        "secondary threads". These include all threads created by Create() or the
        corresponding constructors.
        
        GUI calls, such as those to a wxWindow or wxBitmap are explicitly not safe
        at all in secondary threads and could end your application prematurely.
        This is due to several reasons, including the underlying native API and 
        the fact that wxThread does not run a GUI event loop similar to other APIs
        as MFC.
        
        A workaround for some wxWidgets ports is calling wxMutexGUIEnter()
        before any GUI calls and then calling wxMutexGUILeave() afterwords. However,
        the recommended way is to simply process the GUI calls in the main thread
        through an event that is posted by either wxPostEvent() or
        wxEvtHandler::AddPendingEvent. This does not imply that calls to these 
        classes are thread-safe, however, as most wxWidgets classes are not
        thread-safe, including wxString.
    @section overview_pollwxThread Don't Poll a wxThread
        A common problem users experience with wxThread is that in their main thread
        they will check the thread every now and then to see if it has ended through
        IsRunning(), only to find that their application has run into problems 
        because the thread is using the default behavior and has already deleted 
        itself. Naturally, they instead attempt to use joinable threads in place 
        of the previous behavior. However, polling a wxThread for when it has ended
        is in general a bad idea - in fact calling a routine on any running wxThread 
        should be avoided if possible. Instead, find a way to notify yourself when
        the thread has ended.
        
        Usually you only need to notify the main thread, in which case you can
        post an event to it via wxPostEvent() or wxEvtHandler::AddPendingEvent.
        In the case of secondary threads you can call a routine of another class
        when the thread is about to complete processing and/or set the value of 
        a variable, possibly using mutexes() and/or other synchronization means
        if necessary.

        causing huge performance issues for your application. @b with a
        well-behaving, CPU-efficient thread the operating system is likely to properly
        care for its reactivation the moment it needs it, whereas with
        non-deterministic, Yield-using threads all bets are off and the system
        scheduler is free to penalize drastically, and this effect gets worse
        with increasing system load due to less free CPU resources available.
        You may refer to various Linux kernel sched_yield discussions for more
        information.

/**
    @class wxSemaphore
    @wxheader{thread.h}

    wxSemaphore is a counter limiting the number of threads concurrently accessing
    a shared resource. This counter is always between 0 and the maximum value
    specified during the semaphore creation. When the counter is strictly greater
    than 0, a call to wxSemaphore::Wait returns immediately and
    decrements the counter. As soon as it reaches 0, any subsequent calls to
    wxSemaphore::Wait block and only return when the semaphore
    counter becomes strictly positive again as the result of calling
    wxSemaphore::Post which increments the counter.

    In general, semaphores are useful to restrict access to a shared resource
    which can only be accessed by some fixed number of clients at the same time. For
    example, when modeling a hotel reservation system a semaphore with the counter
    equal to the total number of available rooms could be created. Each time a room
    is reserved, the semaphore should be acquired by calling
    wxSemaphore::Wait and each time a room is freed it should be
    released by calling wxSemaphore::Post.

/**
    @class wxMutex
    @wxheader{thread.h}

    A mutex object is a synchronization object whose state is set to signaled when
    it is not owned by any thread, and nonsignaled when it is owned. Its name comes
    from its usefulness in coordinating mutually-exclusive access to a shared
    resource as only one thread at a time can own a mutex object.

    Mutexes may be recursive in the sense that a thread can lock a mutex which it
    had already locked before (instead of dead locking the entire process in this
    situation by starting to wait on a mutex which will never be released while the
    thread is waiting) but using them is not recommended under Unix and they are
    @b not recursive there by default. The reason for this is that recursive
    mutexes are not supported by all Unix flavours and, worse, they cannot be used
    with wxCondition. On the other hand, Win32 mutexes are
    always recursive.

    For example, when several threads use the data stored in the linked list,
    modifications to the list should only be allowed to one thread at a time
    because during a new node addition the list integrity is temporarily broken
    (this is also called @e program invariant).
