    @class wxImageHandler

    This is the base class for implementing image file loading/saving, and
    image creation from data.
    It is used within wxImage and is not normally seen by the application.

    If you wish to extend the capabilities of wxImage, derive a class from
    wxImageHandler and add the handler using wxImage::AddHandler in your
    application initialization.

    Note that all wxImageHandlers provided by wxWidgets are part of
    the @ref page_libs_wxcore library.
    For details about the default handlers, please see the section
    @ref image_handlers in the wxImage class documentation.


    @section imagehandler_note Note (Legal Issue)

    This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group.
    (Applies when wxWidgets is linked with JPEG support.
    wxJPEGHandler uses libjpeg created by IJG.)

/**
    @class wxImage

    This class encapsulates a platform-independent image.

    An image can be created from data, or using wxBitmap::ConvertToImage.
    An image can be loaded from a file in a variety of formats, and is extensible
    to new formats via image format handlers. Functions are available to set and
    get image bits, so it can be used for basic image manipulation.

    A wxImage cannot (currently) be drawn directly to a wxDC.
    Instead, a platform-specific wxBitmap object must be created from it using
    the wxBitmap::wxBitmap(wxImage,int depth) constructor.
    This bitmap can then be drawn in a device context, using wxDC::DrawBitmap.

    One colour value of the image may be used as a mask colour which will lead to
    the automatic creation of a wxMask object associated to the bitmap object.


    @section image_alpha Alpha channel support

    Starting from wxWidgets 2.5.0 wxImage supports alpha channel data, that is
    in addition to a byte for the red, green and blue colour components for each
    pixel it also stores a byte representing the pixel opacity.

    An alpha value of 0 corresponds to a transparent pixel (null opacity) while
    a value of 255 means that the pixel is 100% opaque.
    The constants ::wxIMAGE_ALPHA_TRANSPARENT and ::wxIMAGE_ALPHA_OPAQUE can be
    used to indicate those values in a more readable form.

    While all images have RGB data, not all images have an alpha channel. Before
    using wxImage::GetAlpha you should check if this image contains an alpha
    channel with wxImage::HasAlpha. Note that currently only the PNG format has
    full alpha channel support so only the images loaded from PNG files can have
    alpha and, if you initialize the image alpha channel yourself using
    wxImage::SetAlpha, you should save it in PNG format to avoid losing it.


    @section image_handlers Available image handlers

    The following image handlers are available.
    wxBMPHandler is always installed by default.
    To use other image formats, install the appropriate handler with
    wxImage::AddHandler or call ::wxInitAllImageHandlers().

    - wxBMPHandler: For loading and saving, always installed.
    - wxPNGHandler: For loading (including alpha support) and saving.
    - wxJPEGHandler: For loading and saving.
    - wxGIFHandler: Only for loading, due to legal issues.
    - wxPCXHandler: For loading and saving (see below).
    - wxPNMHandler: For loading and saving (see below).
    - wxTIFFHandler: For loading and saving.
    - wxTGAHandler: For loading only.
    - wxIFFHandler: For loading only.
    - wxXPMHandler: For loading and saving.
    - wxICOHandler: For loading and saving.
    - wxCURHandler: For loading and saving.
    - wxANIHandler: For loading only.

    When saving in PCX format, wxPCXHandler will count the number of different
    colours in the image; if there are 256 or less colours, it will save as 8 bit,
    else it will save as 24 bit.

    Loading PNMs only works for ASCII or raw RGB images.
    When saving in PNM format, wxPNMHandler will always save as raw RGB.

        This is also useful for scaling bitmaps in general as the only other way
        to scale bitmaps is to blit a wxMemoryDC into another wxMemoryDC.

        The parameter @a quality determines what method to use for resampling
        the image, see wxImageResizeQuality documentation.

        It should be noted that although using @c wxIMAGE_QUALITY_HIGH produces much nicer
        looking results it is a slower method. Downsampling will use the box averaging
        method which seems to operate very fast. If you are upsampling larger images using
        this method you will most likely notice that it is a bit slower and in extreme
        cases it will be quite substantially slower as the bicubic algorithm has to process a
        lot of data.

        It should also be noted that the high quality scaling may not work as expected
        when using a single mask colour for transparency, as the scaling will blur the
        image and will therefore remove the mask partially. Using the alpha channel
        will work.

        Example:
        @code
        // get the bitmap from somewhere
        wxBitmap bmp = ...;

        // rescale it to have size of 32*32

            image.Rescale(32, 32);
            bmp = image;

        Generic options:
        @li @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_MAX_WIDTH and @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_MAX_HEIGHT: If either
            of these options is specified, the loaded image will be scaled down
            (preserving its aspect ratio) so that its width is less than the
            max width given if it is not 0 @em and its height is less than the
            max height given if it is not 0. This is typically used for loading
            thumbnails and the advantage of using these options compared to
            calling Rescale() after loading is that some handlers (only JPEG
            one right now) support rescaling the image during loading which is
            vastly more efficient than loading the entire huge image and
            rescaling it later (if these options are not supported by the
            handler, this is still what happens however). These options must be
            set before calling LoadFile() to have any effect.

        @li @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_QUALITY: JPEG quality used when saving. This is an
            integer in 0..100 range with 0 meaning very poor and 100 excellent
            (but very badly compressed). This option is currently ignored for
            the other formats.

        @li @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_RESOLUTIONUNIT: The value of this option determines
            whether the resolution of the image is specified in centimetres or
            inches, see wxImageResolution enum elements.

        @li @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_RESOLUTION, @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_RESOLUTIONX and
            @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_RESOLUTIONY: These options define the resolution of
            the image in the units corresponding to @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_RESOLUTIONUNIT
            options value. The first option can be set before saving the image
            to set both horizontal and vertical resolution to the same value.
            The X and Y options are set by the image handlers if they support
            the image resolution (currently BMP, JPEG and TIFF handlers do) and
            the image provides the resolution information and can be queried
            after loading the image.

        Options specific to wxPNGHandler:
        @li @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_PNG_FORMAT: Format for saving a PNG file, see
            wxImagePNGType for the supported values.
        @li @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_PNG_BITDEPTH: Bit depth for every channel (R/G/B/A).
        @li @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_PNG_FILTER: Filter for saving a PNG file, see libpng
            (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng-1.2.5-manual.html) for possible values
            (e.g. PNG_FILTER_NONE, PNG_FILTER_SUB, PNG_FILTER_UP, etc).
        @li @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_PNG_COMPRESSION_LEVEL: Compression level (0..9) for
            saving a PNG file. An high value creates smaller-but-slower PNG file.
            Note that unlike other formats (e.g. JPEG) the PNG format is always
            lossless and thus this compression level doesn't tradeoff the image
            quality.
        @li @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_PNG_COMPRESSION_MEM_LEVEL: Compression memory usage
            level (1..9) for saving a PNG file. An high value means the saving
            process consumes more memory, but may create smaller PNG file.
        @li @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_PNG_COMPRESSION_STRATEGY: Possible values are 0 for
            default strategy, 1 for filter, and 2 for Huffman-only.
            You can use OptiPNG (http://optipng.sourceforge.net/) to get a suitable
            value for your application.
        @li @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_PNG_COMPRESSION_BUFFER_SIZE: Internal buffer size
            (in bytes) for saving a PNG file. Ideally this should be as big as
