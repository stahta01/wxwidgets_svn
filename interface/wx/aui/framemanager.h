/**
    @class wxAuiManager

    wxAuiManager is the central class of the wxAUI class framework.
    See also @ref overview_aui.

    wxAuiManager manages the panes associated with it for a particular wxFrame,
    using a pane's wxAuiPaneInfo information to determine each pane's docking
    and floating behavior.

    wxAuiManager uses wxWidgets' sizer mechanism to plan the layout of each frame.
    It uses a replaceable dock art class to do all drawing, so all drawing is
    localized in one area, and may be customized depending on an application's
    specific needs.

    wxAuiManager works as follows: the programmer adds panes to the class,
    or makes changes to existing pane properties (dock position, floating
    state, show state, etc.). To apply these changes, wxAuiManager's
    Update() function is called. This batch processing can be used to avoid
    flicker, by modifying more than one pane at a time, and then "committing"
    all of the changes at once by calling Update().

    Panes can be added quite easily:

    @code
    wxTextCtrl* text1 = new wxTextCtrl(this, -1);
    wxTextCtrl* text2 = new wxTextCtrl(this, -1);
    m_mgr.AddPane(text1, wxLEFT, wxT("Pane Caption"));
    m_mgr.AddPane(text2, wxBOTTOM, wxT("Pane Caption"));
    m_mgr.Update();
    @endcode

    Later on, the positions can be modified easily. The following will float
    an existing pane in a tool window:

    @code
    m_mgr.GetPane(text1).Float();
    @endcode


    @section auimanager_layers Layers, Rows and Directions, Positions

    Inside wxAUI, the docking layout is figured out by checking several pane
    parameters. Four of these are important for determining where a pane will end up:

    @li Direction: Each docked pane has a direction, Top, Bottom, Left, Right, or Center.
        This is fairly self-explanatory. The pane will be placed in the location specified
        by this variable.
    @li Position: More than one pane can be placed inside of a dock. Imagine two panes
        being docked on the left side of a window. One pane can be placed over another.
        In proportionally managed docks, the pane position indicates its sequential position,
        starting with zero. So, in our scenario with two panes docked on the left side,
        the top pane in the dock would have position 0, and the second one would occupy
        position 1.
    @li Row: A row can allow for two docks to be placed next to each other. One of the
        most common places for this to happen is in the toolbar. Multiple toolbar rows
        are allowed, the first row being row 0, and the second row 1. Rows can also be
        used on vertically docked panes.
    @li Layer: A layer is akin to an onion. Layer 0 is the very center of the managed pane.
        Thus, if a pane is in layer 0, it will be closest to the center window (also
        sometimes known as the "content window"). Increasing layers "swallow up" all
        layers of a lower value. This can look very similar to multiple rows, but is
        different because all panes in a lower level yield to panes in higher levels.
        The best way to understand layers is by running the wxAUI sample.
