/**
    @class wxHtmlParser
    @headerfile htmlpars.h wx/html/htmlpars.h

    Classes derived from this handle the @b generic parsing of HTML documents: it
    scans
    the document and divide it into blocks of tags (where one block
    consists of beginning and ending tag and of text between these
    two tags).

    It is independent from wxHtmlWindow and can be used as stand-alone parser
    (Julian Smart's idea of speech-only HTML viewer or wget-like utility -
    see InetGet sample for example).

    It uses system of tag handlers to parse the HTML document. Tag handlers
    are not statically shared by all instances but are created for each
    wxHtmlParser instance. The reason is that the handler may contain
    document-specific temporary data used during parsing (e.g. complicated
    structures like tables).

    Typically the user calls only the wxHtmlParser::Parse method.
