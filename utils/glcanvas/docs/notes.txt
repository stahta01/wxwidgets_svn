Problems with wxGLCanvas, 29/8/98

Only the cube example compiles under wxWin 2 so far.

Major problem: OpenGL seems to do something strange to the
event loop, because wxApp::OnIdle never gets a chance to be
called, and therefore delayed deletion (and all other
idle-related processing) doesn't get done. This is why closing
the app doesn't work.

What does OpenGL do to message processing, and what can be done
about it? Why did it work OK for wxWin 1.xx? It's as if
there's _always_ a message in the queue (PeekMessage always
returns non-zero). Perhaps we need to discover what the message
is it's always returning.
