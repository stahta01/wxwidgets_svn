Version 2.0

\begin{itemize}\itemsep=0pt
\item No Motif version yet.
\item Some control properties missing.
\item When dragging a selected item, other selected items should follow (to be
consistent with convention), but don't.
\item No grid.
\item No keyboard shortcuts.
\item No tab ordering.
\item In dialog unit mode, controls will sometimes move slightly when properties are edited,
because translating between units isn't always reversible (rounding errors?).
\end{itemize}
