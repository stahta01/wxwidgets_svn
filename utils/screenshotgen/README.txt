 This utility is developed to generate automatically screenshots of the wxWidgets
 controls for use in wxWidgets documentation.

 The main part of the GUI (guiframe.h/guiframe.cpp) is generated with wxFormBuilder
 (http://wxformbuilder.org/), a powerful cross-platform open-source RAD tool.
 To add a control that wxFormBuilder doesn't support directly, "custom controls"
 feature of wxFormBuilder has been used.

 Please DO NOT modify guiframe.h/guiframe.cpp; modify the code in the wxFormBuilder
 project file, instead.
