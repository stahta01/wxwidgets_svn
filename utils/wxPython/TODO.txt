wxPython TODO List
------------------

These are the major tasks to be done on wxPython:

1. Get it working for wxGTK.

2. Figure out how to do embedding of wxPython in a wxWindows C++
application.

    Actually, now that I think about it it might actually work.  We
    just need to ensure that __wxStart is not called and that a wxApp
    is not created.  So this task becomes: Create a test case for
    embedding wxPython in a C++ app.  Should also create some helper
    functions for passing window objects into the Python code, etc.

3. Derived Python classes should have the ability to call the standard
On** methods in the base class.

4. There are some virtual On** and other methods in wxWindows that
should end up being callbacks in derived python classes, but they are
not called via the standard event system.  Is there any way to hook
into these and call Python methods (if they exist in the derived
class) without having to derive a specialized C++ class?

5. Add the Doc/View related classes

6. Add the Printing related classes

7. Document the differences (method signatures, new methods to
compensate for no overloading, etc.) between wxPython and wxWindows.
