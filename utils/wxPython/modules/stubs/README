What's in here:

Makefile.pre.in
	A custom Makefile.pre.in, originally by Robin Dunn as part of the
	wxPython source distribution. Intented for separate wxPython
	modules, it should require little or no modification for other
	module projects

Setup.in
	A custom Setup.in for building the modules below. It expects to find
	the wxPython source dir in the directory specified by WXP_SRCDIR.
	All modules are linked agains libwx_pymodule.so, which should
	contain the SWIG runtime code and wxPython's helpers.cpp code.
