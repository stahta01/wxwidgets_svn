What's in here:

html
	-- minimal wrap of Vaclaf Slavik's wxHTML (now part of
	wxWindows); only parts of the wxHtmlWindow class are used.
	Testsample htmlview.py.
	There's also a python tag handler, see htmlwidget.py for
	a demonstration.

Aug. 31 1999
	Added wxHtmlHelpController and wxHtmlHelpSystem wrappers
	wxHtmlHelpSystem is a subclass of the controller, and is still very
	rough around the edges. The idea is that it gives the python
	programmer more freedom in the look'n'feel of the html help window.
	Will be opening up negotiations on the wxwin list to see if
	the wxHtmlController code can be reorganised in a base and GUI
	part.
