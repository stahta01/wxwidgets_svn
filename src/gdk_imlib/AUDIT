Audit status of gdk_imlib so far:

cache.c appears clean
globals.c appears clean

load.c:
	JPEG, PNG, GIF and TIFF loaders seem safe but the underlying
		yet libraries have not been checked
	Helper stuff should now be safe.

misc.c
	The obvious screwups have been remedied with the usual 
	length checking sscanfs and snprintfs.
	Rewrote a little of the parsing code to avoid future problems.

rend.c
	Appears ok

save.c 
	Some stuff has been fixed. The helpers should be safe but
	are incomplete

utils.c
	Ok this seems clean now. There's a few  FIXME's but they are
	either new features (helper needs %Q) or bogus but non fatal
	stuff
