wxWindows main upstream site is www.wxwindows.org

wxWindows is licenced under the LGPL with a special exception for
binary only apps produced with it.  Some parts of the library (as
compiled for Debian) might *not* include this extra exception in
their licence.  If you wish to distribute binary object code under
terms other than those allowed by the (L)GPL (but allowed by the
wxWindows Licence), you must first ensure all linked in code is
subject to this exception.  This package is almost certainly built
with code licenced under terms which do not include that exception.


   See the file licence.txt for authorative details of
                  the wxWindows licence.
