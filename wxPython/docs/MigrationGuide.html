<h1 class="title">wxPython 2.5 Migration Guide</h1>
<p>This document will help explain some of the major changes in wxPython
2.5 and let you know what you need to do to adapt your programs to
those changes.  Be sure to also check in the CHANGES.txt file like
usual to see info about the not so major changes and other things that
have been added to wxPython.</p>
<div class="section" id="module-initialization">
<h1><a name="module-initialization">Module Initialization</a></h1>
<p>The import-startup-bootstrap process employed by wxPython was changed
such that wxWindows and the underlying gui toolkit are <strong>not</strong>
initialized until the wx.App object is created (but before wx.App.OnInit
is called.)  This was required because of some changes that were made
to the C++ wxApp class.</p>
<p>There are both benefits and potential problems with this change.  The
benefits are that you can import wxPython without requiring access to
a GUI (for checking version numbers, etc.) and that in a
multi-threaded environment the thread that creates the app object will
now be the GUI thread instead of the one that imports wxPython.  Some
potential problems are that the C++ side of the &quot;stock-objects&quot;
(wx.BLUE_PEN, wx.TheColourDatabase, etc.) are not initialized until
the wx.App object is created, so you should not use them until after
you have created your wx.App object.  (In fact, until I find a better
solution trying to use one of the stock objects before the app is
created will probably result in a crash.)</p>
<p>Also, you will probably not be able to do any kind of GUI or bitmap
operation unless you first have created an app object, (even on
Windows where most anything was possible before.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="swig-1-3">
<h1><a name="swig-1-3">SWIG 1.3</a></h1>
<p>wxPython is now using SWIG 1.3.x from CVS (with several of my own
customizations added that I hope to get folded back into the main SWIG
distribution.)  This has some far reaching ramifications:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All classes derive from object and so all are now &quot;new-style
classes&quot;</p>
<p>Public data members of the C++ classes are wrapped as Python
properties using property() instead of using __getattr__/__setattr__
like before.  Normally you shouldn't notice any difference, but if
you were previously doing something with __getattr__/__setattr__
in derived classes then you may have to adjust things.</p>
<p>Static C++ methods are wrapped using the staticmethod()
feature of Python and so are accessible as ClassName.MethodName
as expected.  They are still available as top level functions
ClassName_MethodName as before.</p>
<p>The relationship between the wxFoo and wxFooPtr classes have
changed for the better.  Specifically, all instances that you see
will be wxFoo even if they are created internally using wxFooPtr,
because wxFooPtr.__init__ will change the instance's __class__ as
part of the initialization.  If you have any code that checks
class type using something like isinstance(obj, wxFooPtr) you will
need to change it to isinstance(obj, wxFoo).</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="binding-events">
<h1><a name="binding-events">Binding Events</a></h1>
<p>All of the EVT_* functions are now instances of the wx.PyEventBinder
class.  They have a __call__ method so they can still be used as
functions like before, but making them instances adds some
flexibility.</p>
<p>wx.EvtHandler (the base class for wx.Window) now has a Bind method that
makes binding events to windows a little easier.  Here is its
definition and docstring:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def Bind(self, event, handler, source=None, id=wxID_ANY, id2=wxID_ANY):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Bind an event to an event handler.

      event     One of the EVT_* objects that specifies the
                type of event to bind.

      handler   A callable object to be invoked when the event
                is delivered to self.  Pass None to disconnect an
                event handler.

      source    Sometimes the event originates from a different window
                than self, but you still want to catch it in self.  (For
                example, a button event delivered to a frame.)  By
                passing the source of the event, the event handling
                system is able to differentiate between the same event
                type from different controls.

      id,id2    Used for menu IDs or for event types that require a
                range of IDs

    &quot;&quot;&quot;
</pre>
<p>Some examples of its use:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
self.Bind(wx.EVT_SIZE,   self.OnSize)
self.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.OnButtonClick, theButton)
self.Bind(wx.EVT_MENU,   self.OnExit, id=ID_EXIT)
</pre>
<p>I hope to be able to remove the need for using IDs even for menu
events too...</p>
<p>If you create your own custom event types and EVT_* functions, and you
want to be able to use them with the Bind method above then you should
change your EVT_* to be an instance of wxPyEventBinder instead of a
function.  If you used to have something like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
myCustomEventType = wxNewEventType()
def EVT_MY_CUSTOM_EVENT(win, id, func):
    win.Connect(id, -1, myCustomEventType, func)
</pre>
<p>Change it like so:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
myCustomEventType = wxNewEventType()
EVT_MY_CUSTOM_EVENT = wxPyEventBinder(myCustomEventType, 1)
</pre>
<p>The second parameter is an integer in [0, 1, 2] that specifies the
number of IDs that are needed to be passed to Connect.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-wx-namespace">
<h1><a name="the-wx-namespace">The wx Namespace</a></h1>
<p>The second phase of the wx Namespace Transition has begun.  That means
that the real names of the classes and other symbols do not have the
'wx' prefix and the modules are located in a Python package named
wx.  There is still a Python package named wxPython with modules
that have the names with the wx prefix for backwards compatibility.
Instead of dynamically changing the names at module load time like in
2.4, the compatibility modules are generated at build time and contain
assignment statements like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
wxWindow = wx.core.Window
</pre>
<p>Don't let the &quot;core&quot; in the name bother you.  That and some other
modules are implementation details, and everything that was in the
wxPython.wx before will still be in the wx package namespace after
this change.  So from your code you would use it as wx.Window.</p>
<p>A few notes about how all of this was accomplished might be
interesting...  SWIG is now run twice for each module that it is
generating code for.  The first time it outputs an XML representaion
of the parse tree, which can be up to 20MB and 300K lines in size!
That XML is then run through a little Python script that creates a
file full of SWIG %rename directives that take the wx off of the
names, and also generates the Python compatibility file described
above that puts the wx back on the names.  SWIG is then run a second
time to generate the C++ code to implement the extension module, and
uses the %rename directives that were generated in the first step.</p>
<p>Not every name is handled correctly (but the bulk of them are) and so
some work has to be done by hand, especially for the reverse-renamers.
So expect a few flaws here and there until everything gets sorted out.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="new-wx-dc-methods">
<h1><a name="new-wx-dc-methods">New wx.DC Methods</a></h1>
<p>Many of the Draw methods of wx.DC have alternate forms in C++ that take
wxPoint or wxSize parameters (let's call these <em>Type A</em>) instead of
the individual x, y, width, height, etc. parameters (and we'll call
these <em>Type B</em>).  In the rest of the library I normally made the <em>Type
A</em> forms of the methods be the default method with the &quot;normal&quot; name,
and had renamed the <em>Type B</em> forms of the methods to some similar
name.  For example in wx.Window we have these Python methods:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
SetSize(size)               # Type A
SetSizeWH(width, height)    # Type B
</pre>
<p>For various reasons the new <em>Type A</em> methods in wx.DC were never added
and the existing <em>Type B</em> methods renamed.  Now that lots of other
things are also changing in wxPython that it has been decided that it
is a good time to also do the method renaming in wx.DC too, in order
to be consistent with the rest of the library.  The methods in wx.DC
that are affected are listed here:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
FloodFillXY(x, y, colour, style = wx.FLOOD_SURFACE)
FloodFill(point, colour,  style = wx.FLOOD_SURFACE)

GetPixelXY(x, y)
GetPixel(point)

DrawLineXY(x1, y1, x2, y2)
DrawLine(point1, point2)

CrossHairXY(x, y)
CrossHair(point)

DrawArcXY(x1, y1, x2, y2, xc, yc)
DrawArc(point1, point2, center)

DrawCheckMarkXY(x, y, width, height)
DrawCheckMark(rect)

DrawEllipticArcXY(x, y, w, h, start_angle, end_angle)
DrawEllipticArc(point, size, start_angle, end_angle)

DrawPointXY(x, y)
DrawPoint(point)

DrawRectangleXY(x, y, width, height)
DrawRectangle(point, size)
DrawRectangleRect(rect)

DrawRoundedRectangleXY(x, y, width, height, radius)
DrawRoundedRectangle(point, size, radius)
DrawRoundedRectangleRect(rect, radius)

DrawCircleXY(x, y, radius)
DrawCircle(point, radius)

DrawEllipseXY(x, y, width, height)
DrawEllipse(point, size)
DrawEllipseRect(rect)

DrawIconXY(icon, x, y)
DrawIcon(icon, point)

DrawBitmapXY(bmp, x, y, useMask = FALSE)
DrawBitmap(bmp, point, useMask = FALSE)

DrawTextXY(text, x, y)
DrawText(text, point)

DrawRotatedTextXY(text, x, y, angle)
DrawRotatedText(text, point, angle)


BlitXY(xdest, ydest, width, height, sourceDC, xsrc, ysrc,
       rop = wxCOPY, useMask = FALSE, xsrcMask = -1, ysrcMask = -1)
Blit(destPt, size, sourceDC, srcPt,
     rop = wxCOPY, useMask = FALSE, srcPtMask = wx.DefaultPosition)
</pre>
<p>If you have code that draws on a DC you <strong>will</strong> get errors because of
these changes, but it should be easy to fix the code.  You can either
change the name of the <em>Type B</em> method called as shown above, or just
add parentheses around the parameters as needed to turn them into
tuples and let the SWIG typemaps turn them into the wx.Point or
wx.Size object that is expected.  For example, if you had this code
before:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
dc.DrawRectangle(x, y, width, height)
</pre>
<p>You could just change it like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
dc.DrawRectangle((x, y), (width, height))
</pre>
<p>Or if you were already using a point and size:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
dc.DrawRectangle(p.x, p.y, s.width, s.height)
</pre>
<p>Then you can just change it like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
dc.DrawRectangle(p, s)
</pre>

<div class="section" id="building-extending-and-embedding-wxpython">
<h1><a name="building-extending-and-embedding-wxpython">Building, Extending and Embedding wxPython</a></h1>
<p>wxPython's setup.py script now expects to use existing libraries for
the contribs (gizmos, stc, xrc, etc.) rather than building local
copies of them.  If you build your own copies of wxPython please be
aware that you now need to also build the ogl, stc, xrc, and gizmos
libraries in addition to the main wx lib.  [[TODO: update the
BUILD.*.txt files too!]]</p>
<p>The wxPython.h and other header files are now in
.../wxPython/include/wx/wxPython instead of in wxPython/src.  You should
include it via the &quot;wx/wxPython/wxPython.h&quot; path and add
.../wxPython/include to your list of include paths.  [[TODO:  Install
these headers on Linux...]]</p>
<p>You no longer need to call wxClassInfo::CleanUpClasses() and
wxClassInfo::InitializeClasses() in your extensions or when embedding
wxPython.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-stuff">
<h1><a name="other-stuff">Other Stuff</a></h1>
<p>Instead of over a dozen separate extension modules linked together
into a single extension module, the &quot;core&quot; module is now just a few
extensions that are linked independently, and then merged together
later into the main namespace via Python code.</p>
<p>Because of the above, the &quot;internal&quot; module names have changed, but
you shouldn't have been using them anyway so it shouldn't bother
you. ;-)</p>
