0.1.6-6
-------

Improved some dialogs (window styles, growable cols). Changed the
range for wxSpinCtrl min/max to all integers (default 0/100 is not
always good).

0.1.6-5
-------

Fixed testing for any element inside object tree.

0.1.6-4
-------

Fixed replacing op for sizer children and spacer objects. 
UndoReplace is not yet implemented.

0.1.6-3
-------

Fix for crash when opening new file with active tree selection.
Replacing controls bug fixed.

0.1.6-2
-------

wxMSW wxTreeCtrl behaviour is still different from wxGTK for
wxTR_MULTIPLE, some fixes for this.

0.1.6-1
-------

New (experimental ;) ) feature: support for "object_ref" tag, for
creating references to named objects (see tn0014.txt). "reference..." 
menu command creates new object_ref node. Properties of the top-level
object can be overriden, but overriding child controls is not working
as expected (maybe a bug in wx).

0.1.5-3
-------

xxxStdDialogButtonSizer pulldown menu with standard buttons.

Some fixes for selecting tools inside toolbar with test window open
(whole toolbar is selected).

Toolbars can be added inside windows.

0.1.5-2
-------

Using wx.GetDefaultPyEncoding/wx.SetDefaultPyEncoding for changing active encoding.

Fixed pasting siblings (Ctrl key pressed while pasting).

Dealed with ascii build (Python does not recognize 'ascii' as valid encoding).
If encoding is not specified it is not written in XRC. Will add more
customization in the future.

Changed to use SimpleTool instead or Toggle tool (does not work on Win32).

0.1.5-1
-------

Added wxWizard, wxWizardPageSimple (only from pull-down menu). 

Hide command for test window.

Replacing classes works better.

Added Locate tool.

0.1.4-1
-------

Edit->Locate command (Ctrl-L) for quick selection of items.
Works with event-handling controls (buttons, text fields) but
not with labels/sizers.

Some improvements: relative paths for files supplied as command-
line argument work correctly, notebook panels are highlighted 
better.

0.1.2-1
_______

Added support for wxGridBagSizer (supported in wxPython 2.5).

0.1.1-5
-------

Added subclass attribute.

0.1.1-4
-------

Fixed problems with wxStaticBitmap (stock_id attribute, icon type
switching).

Changed some dimensions in properties panel elements.

0.1.1-3
-------

Sizes of some controls were not normal on wxMSW. Fixed.

Some changes to test window code to make it resize better and to 
have focus control with sawfish for all types of windows.

0.1.1-2
-------

Bugs with currentEncoding and frame testing fixed.

Some required parameters are set to default if missing.

Unsupported classes are tolerated, with warning message.

wxScrolledWindow added (to 'control' pulldown menu, not yet to the
tool palette).

Multi-line editing for labels and some values (wxTextCtrl,
wxHtmlWindow).

0.1.1-1
-------

Changed internationalization support. '-i' option removed, default
encoding is used (should be defined in sitecustomize.py, or 'ascii' by
default). When XRC file is opened with encoding specified,
translations are not used.

0.1.1
-----

Replace command added (not quite finished yet).

0.1.0
-----

Finally implemented tools panel for almost all controls (except
wxHtmlWindow, wxCalendarCtrl and wxGenericDirCtrl - they are too
rarely used).

Changed some sizes in panel to better work with different fonts.

Fixed double-refreshing after Ctrl+R.

Maybe something else that I've forgot. It's been a looong day... :)


0.0.9-6
-------

Added dialog unit support.

Dealing with non-specified required values (set to defaults, if exist).

Added 'minsize' parameter of sizeritem.

Added '-i' option to turn off translations and use international characters.

0.0.9-5
-------

Mac platform-specific checks.

0.0.9-4
-------

Implemented standard bitmap selection.

Fixed a bug in FlexGridSizer code.

0.0.9-3
-------

File browsing (for bitmaps/icons, etc.) had a small problem when current 
file was not saved yet.

0.0.9-2
-------

Small bug fix for initial don't panic message.

0.0.9-1
-------

Changed program structure, reduced use of global variables (grouped in
module 'globals', which creates an instanse 'g' of class Globals.

First version of undo/redo working!

Support for toolbars inside panels and frames.

Added 'container' submenu for creating Panel, Notebook and ToolBar objects.

wxMSW-only: added code to switch focus back to main window when test
window is updated.

0.0.8-2
-------

Fixed unicode problem for unicode build.

0.0.8-1
-------

Using WX_2_4_BRANCH.

Added new controls: wxSpinCtrl, wxGenericDirCtrl, unknown (custom
control), improved wxXRC format suppor (menu styles, etc.).

Some I18N support: parsing "encoding" attribute in XML header, later
it can be modified in "properties" panel for "XML tree".

UNIX note: currently XML writing for non-ascii chars works only if
sys.getdefaultencoding() returns good value. To do this, one has to
put following lines to "sitecustomize.py" file:

# Start code segment
import sys
sys.setdefaultencoding('iso-8859-1')	# or whatever
# End code segment

0.0.7
-----

Some command-line arguments.

"Test window" command and toolbar button.

New panel interphace (wxHTMLWindow is not used anymore).

Toggling between embedded and detached panel.

Cache for already used windows.

Current top-level control is bold, if test window shown.

Undo/redo broken.

CheckListBox does not work unless wxXRC source fixed (in both wxPytnon and
wxWin):

contrib/src/xrc/xmlrsall.cpp
45,46c45,46
<     AddHandler(new wxListCtrlXmlHandler);
< #if CHECKLISTBOX
---
>     AddHandler(new wxListCtrlXmlHandler);    
> #if wxUSE_CHECKLISTBOX

This is fixed in CVS.

Changed parameter objects, added support for multiple parameters (like 
`growablecols').

Fixed double-clicking problem with tree control on Windows.

Some performance improovements.
