What is PyCrust?
----------------
PyCrust is an interactive Python environment written in Python.
PyCrust components can run standalone or be integrated into other
development environments and/or other Python applications.

PyCrust comes with an interactive Python shell (PyShell), an 
interactive namespace/object tree control (PyFilling) and an 
integrated, split-window combination of the two (PyCrust).


What is PyCrust good for?

Have you ever tried to bake a pie without one? Well, you
shouldn't build a Python program without a PyCrust either.
