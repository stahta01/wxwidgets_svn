0.1.0
-----

Finally implemented tools panel for almost all controls (except
wxHtmlWindow, wxCalendarCtrl and wxGenericDirCtrl - they are too
rarely used).

Changed some sizes in panel to better work with different fonts.

Fixed double-refreshing after Ctrl+R.

Maybe something else that I've forgot. It's been a looong day... :)

0.0.9-6

Added dialog unit support.

Dealing with non-specified required values (set to defaults, if exist).

-------

Mac platform-specific checks.

File browsing (for bitmaps/icons, etc.) had a small problem when current 
file was not saved yet.

Small bug fix for initial don't panic message.

0.0.9-1
-------

Changed program structure, reduced use of global variables (grouped in
module 'globals', which creates an instanse 'g' of class Globals.

First version of undo/redo working!

Support for toolbars inside panels and frames.

0.0.8-1
-------

Using WX_2_4_BRANCH.

Added new controls: wxSpinCtrl, wxGenericDirCtrl, unknown (custom
control), improved wxXRC format suppor (menu styles, etc.).

Some I18N support: parsing "encoding" attribute in XML header, later
it can be modified in "properties" panel for "XML tree".

UNIX note: currently XML writing for non-ascii chars works only if
sys.getdefaultencoding() returns good value. To do this, one has to
put following lines to "sitecustomize.py" file:

# Start code segment
import sys
sys.setdefaultencoding('iso-8859-1')	# or whatever
# End code segment

Current top-level control is bold, if test window shown.

Undo/redo broken.

CheckListBox does not work unless wxXRC source fixed (in both wxPytnon and
wxWin):

contrib/src/xrc/xmlrsall.cpp
45,46c45,46
<     AddHandler(new wxListCtrlXmlHandler);
