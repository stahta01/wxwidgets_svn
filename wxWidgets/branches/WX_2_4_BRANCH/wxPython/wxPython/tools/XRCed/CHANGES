0.0.8-1
-------

Using WX_2_4_BRANCH.

Added new controls: wxSpinCtrl, wxGenericDirCtrl, unknown (custom
control), improved wxXRC format suppor (menu styles, etc.).

Some I18N support: parsing "encoding" attribute in XML header, later
it can be modified in "properties" panel for "XML tree".

UNIX note: currently XML writing for non-ascii chars works only if
sys.getdefaultencoding() returns good value. To do this, one has to
put following lines to "sitecustomize.py" file:

# Start code segment
import sys
sys.setdefaultencoding('iso-8859-1')	# or whatever
# End code segment

0.0.7
-----

Some command-line arguments.

"Test window" command and toolbar button.

New panel interphace (wxHTMLWindow is not used anymore).

Toggling between embedded and detached panel.

Cache for already used windows.

Current top-level control is bold, if test window shown.

Undo/redo broken.

CheckListBox does not work unless wxXRC source fixed (in both wxPytnon and
wxWin):

contrib/src/xrc/xmlrsall.cpp
45,46c45,46
<     AddHandler(new wxListCtrlXmlHandler);
< #if CHECKLISTBOX
---
>     AddHandler(new wxListCtrlXmlHandler);    
> #if wxUSE_CHECKLISTBOX

This is fixed in CVS.
