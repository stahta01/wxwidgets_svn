Installing latest headers (and Carbon Support)
----------------------------------------------

NOTE : these steps are not necessary for Pro 6, only for Pro 5.3

the latest build for carbon support lead to a few changes you will have to
follow, in order to successfully compile the code (also necessary if you don't
want to build the carbon targets)

1. you need CodeWarrior Pro 5.3 , i.e. 5.0 with all the upgrades
2. you have to download the 3.4.0 (or greater) universal interfaces from 
	ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Development_Kits/UniversalHeaders3.4.1.img.bin
3. put the Interfaces and Libraries Folder into the MacOS Support folder and replace older versions
4. remove from the MacOS Support folder the separate OpenTransport folder
5. open the file MacOS Support:MacHeaders:MacHeaders.c and add the line
		#include <ControlDefinitions.h>
	after the 
		#include <Controls.h>
6. rebuild all MacHeaders from the MacHeaders.mcp project in the same folder

if you want to build the carbon targets, you will also need the latest
carbonized version of MSL from Metrowerks, at the time of writing, this meant
applying the changes from the folders
CodeWarrior Pro 5:Pre-Release:Carbon & MacOSX Development:Carbonized MSL and
CodeWarrior Pro 5:Pre-Release:Carbon & MacOSX Development:Carbonized Runtimes 
(consult the file CodeWarrior Pro 5:Pre-Release:Carbon & MacOSX Development:Carbon & MacOSX README)

setup.h
-------

in order to build wxMac with CodeWarrior, you must copy or alias the file
include/wx/mac/setup0.h to include/wx/setup.h.

this step is not needed when using the Apple Developer Tools under Mac OS X
since the setup.h file is automatically generated during the configuration.

OpenGL
------

In order to build opengl support with CodeWarrior, you must install the opengl
libraries and headers from http://developer.apple.com/opengl/index.html

If you want OpenGL support with CodeWarrior, set wxUSE_OPENGL to 1 in
include/wx/setup.h

If you don't want OpenGl support, remove the file "glcanvas.cpp" from the
project before compilation and leave the setting at 0

If you want OpenGL support with the Apple Developer Tools under Mac OS X, add
--with-opengl to the arguments of configure when configuring wxMac.

Project Files
-------------

The project files are stored as xml text files and converted to binary
CodeWarrior projects in the distribution (see AppleScript Files below):
  - *M5.xml -> *M5.mcp for CodeWarrior 5.3
  - *M6.xml -> *M6.mcp for CodeWarrior 6
  - *M7.xml -> *M7.mcp for CodeWarrior 7

In order to build the library (and then the samples) you need to make the
following projects (for 5.3)
:src:wxxindowsM5.mcp
:src:png:pngM5.mcp
:src:tiff:tiffM5.mcp
:src:jpeg:jpegM5.mcp
:src:zlib:zlibM5.mcp

AppleScript Files
-----------------

Several AppleScript files are provided in the docs:mac directory (currently
only for CodeWarrior 5.3 related projects):
  - M5xml2mcp.applescript to convert xml files to CodeWarrior projects
  - M5mcp2xml.applescript to convert CodeWarrior projects to xml files
  - M5build.applescript to automatically build all samples/demos projects

Apple Developers Tools
----------------------

As in all Unix projects, you need to do something like this under MacOS 10.1
with the Apple Developers Tools installed:

1) cd into the base dir
2) mkdir build
3) cd build
4) ../configure
5) make

If you want to install the library, you need to be able to log in as "root".
For this, "root" has to be activated in the NetInfo utility - there you will
also have to choose a password for the "root" user. Then

6) su
7) type <PASSWORD>
8) make install
9) exit

Note:
You might want to configure a static library instead:

4) ../configure --disable-shared

or activate OpenGL:

4) ../configure --with-opengl


Problems with .xpm files
------------------------

if you have downloaded all the files and get errors like :

Error   : the file 'wx/generic/tip.xpm' cannot be opened
tipdlg.cpp line 201   #include "wx/generic/tip.xpm"

then your cvs has changed the type of the .xpm files to something other than
text, in order to fix this either change the type by using a resource editor
or drag the files from /include/wx/generic/..xpm on the SetTypeFromExtension
application that is included in this folder. This small applet itself queries
the Internet Config, so you will have to associate the "xpm" extension with
CodeWarrior before making use of this applet.

Missing PLStringFuncsLib
------------------------

You will have to build All Targets for MacOS Support:Libraries:Sources:PLStringFuncs:Glue:PLStringFuncsGlue.mcp
