    how Paste/Cut work with undo/redo in wxTextCtrl?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   problems with large fonts!

wxComboBox

+   draw the button correctly
+   position popup inside the screen

samples:

    add SetString button to lboxtest

wxTextCtrl

*   PageUp/Down keys support
*   caret leaves traces under wxGTK
?   text ctrl display pb when text is truncated
?   too much is refreshed when double clicking (word select)

All

!   wxThemeSettings
!   actions/wxInputHandler?

*   wxCheckListBox: redraw only the bitmap when toggled

?   problem with lbox horz scrolling: the focus rect isn't drawn entirely...

*   popup menu for text ctrls

MSW

*   checkboxes don't look correctly in checked+disabled state (radio too?)
*   (disabled only) text control scrollbar has text cursor
*   the corner between 2 scrollbars should behave as a size grip in a frame

?   scrollbar behaves strangely in log lbox with many strings

GTK

?   listbox scrolling leaves unpainted areas
*   focused textctrl doesn't have focus border

DONE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

All

+   adjust refresh/scroll for WrapLines() case
+   text ctrl horz scrolling
+   DoDraw should iterate over update region instead of using bounding box
+   listbox: horz scrollbar doesn't appear
+   wxTextCtrl update rect overlaps with horz scrollbar
+   scrollbars don't disappear after deleting long line
+   vertical cursor movement should remember the original x position
+   remember selection when losing/gaining activation
+   scrolling by dragging mouse outside the window
+   display corrupted when typing text in quickly (single line only)

MSW

+   wxTextCtrl caret is not shown until *next* refresh

GTK

+   check/radio box remains pressed in win32 mode
+   wxCheckListBox::HitTest doesn't work (clicking the check)
