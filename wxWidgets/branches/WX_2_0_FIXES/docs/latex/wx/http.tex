\membersection{wxHTTP::GetInputStream}\label{wxhttpgetinputstream}

\func{wxInputStream *}{GetInputStream}{\param{const wxString\&}{ path}}

Creates a new input stream on the the specified path. You can use all except the seek
functionality of wxStream. Seek isn't available on all streams. For example,
http or ftp streams doesn't deal with it. Other functions like StreamSize and
Tell aren't available for the moment for this sort of stream.
You will be notified when the EOF is reached by an error.

\wxheading{Return value}

Returns the initialized stream. You will have to delete it yourself once you
don't use it anymore. The destructor closes the network connection.
The next time you will try to get a file the network connection will have
to be reestablished: but you don't have to take care of this wxHTTP reestablishes it automatically.

\membersection{wxHTTP::SetHeader}

\func{void}{SetHeader}{\param{const wxString\&}{ header}, \param{const wxString\&}{ h_data}}

It sets data of a field to be sent during the next request to the HTTP server. The field
name is specified by \it{header} and the content by \it{h_data}.
This is a low level function and it assumes that you know what you are doing.

\membersection{wxHTTP::SetHeader}

\func{wxString}{GetHeader}{\param{const wxString\&}{ header}}

Returns the data attached with a field whose name is specified by \it{header}.
If the field doesn't exist, it will return an empty string and not a NULL string.
