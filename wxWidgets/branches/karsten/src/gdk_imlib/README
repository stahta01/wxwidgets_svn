If you have picked up a net release of imlib you should be able to
just follow the instructions in the INSTALL file.

If you are using imlib out of the CVS repository, then you need to
have some extra tools installed, and the configuration process is
lengthier.  the HACKING file has all the details for building from a
CVS checkout.

Imlib will run MARKEDLY better if you get certain libraries. Notably,
libjpeg, libpng, libtiff and libgif. For more information please go look at:

This will give links to everything you need or may want for Imlib's optimal
functionality.
