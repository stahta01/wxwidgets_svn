What's in here:

Makefile.pre.in
	A custom Makefile.pre.in, originally by Robin Dunn as part of the
	wxPython source distribution. Intented for separate wxPython
	modules, it should require little or no modification for other
	module projects. In these modules they are all identical, except
	the one for glcanvas (copies gtk/glcanvas from elsewhere)

Setup.in
	A custom Setup.in for building the modules below. It expects to find
	the wxPython source dir in the directory specified by WXP_SRCDIR.
	All modules are linked agains libwx_pymodule.so, which should
	contain the SWIG runtime code and wxPython's helpers.cpp code.
	
makefile.vc
	Very small makefile (list of variable's really). It has a big
	brother, makeinc.vc, in the modules dir which is shared by all
	modules and does the real work.
