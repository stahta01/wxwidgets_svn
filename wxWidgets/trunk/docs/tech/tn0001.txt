                    How to add a new sample to wxWindows.
                    =====================================

To add a new sample "foo" under directory "samples/foo" you need to do
the following: (note that all this applies also to demos: just replace
samples/ with demos/ where needed).

1. Create the directory samples/foo locally and "cvs add" it

2. Put the sources, headers and foo.rc file in it and "cvs add" them too
   (don't forget to use "-kb" switch for binary files)

3. Create the makefiles for Windows compilers. There are several ways to do
   it:
   a) copy the makefiles from samples/minimal, replace all occurrences of
      minimal with foo
   b) use bakefile (http://bakefile.sourceforge.net/)

4. Modify configure.in and samples/configure.in for Unix compilation:
   a) if the sample should only be built if "wxUSE_FOO" is enabled, locate
      the test for "wxUSE_FOO = yes" in configure.in and add a line
      SAMPLES_SUBDIRS="$SAMPLES_SUBDIRS foo" under it
   b) if it should be always built, locate the line "if test $wxUSE_GUI = yes"
      near the end of configure.in and modify the assignment to
      SAMPLES_SUBDIRS to include "foo" (put in alphabetical order)
   c) add foo/Makefile to AC_OUTPUT in samples/configure.in

   After this, regenerate configure and samples/configure from configure.in
   by running "autoconf" on a Unix system in the corresponding directory.

5. Add a short description of what the sample does and how does it work
   to the "samples overview" section in the wxWindows manual. That section
   lives in docs/latex/wx/tsamples.tex; look at the descriptions for other
   samples, if you are not familiar with LaTeX.
