General ToDo
------------

- Suggestion from Janos Vegh: the memory-checking classes could
  also keep return the size of memory currently allocated, with
  a call to return it e.g. int wxDebugContext::GetMemoryUsed().
  Maybe even an optional window in debug mode with a tally of memory
  usage, how many classes of each kind are in use, etc.? That
  would be neat.

- Documentation: mention include files with each class.

- Document/update wxTime.

- Document wxSpinCtrl & wxFontMapper.

- Fix TCP/IP mode in dde sample (how to use; why does it crash).

- In doc/view file selector, document type is selected by
  extension, not the type selected in the (Windows) file selector.

- Add all makefiles/documentation for utils/serialize.

- Implement wxScrolledWindow::OnChar to scroll the window using
  the keyboard.

- Documentation for ODBC classes

For 2.1: small changes not involving rewriting anything
-------------------------------------------------------

- wxArrayDouble class?

- generate CREATE/DESTROY events just after/before a window (any window, not
  just frame/dialog) is created/deleted

- Dynamic menu handling: wxMenuBar::DeleteMenu(), InsertMenu()

For 2.2: major new additions
-------------------------------------------------------

- Unicode support (Win32 only probably)

- DnD and OLE clipboard, uniform DnD/clipboard handling
