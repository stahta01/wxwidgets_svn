General ToDo
------------

Please see also:

  docs/gtk/todo.txt
  docs/motif/todo.txt
  docs/msw/todo.txt

- Suggestion from Janos Vegh: the memory-checking classes could
  also keep return the size of memory currently allocated, with
  a call to return it e.g. int wxDebugContext::GetMemoryUsed().
  Maybe even an optional window in debug mode with a tally of memory
  usage, how many classes of each kind are in use, etc.? That
  would be neat.

- Documentation: mention include files with each class.

- Document/update wxTime.

- Fix TCP/IP mode in dde sample (how to use; why does it crash).

- Remove trashed CVS files:

  include/wx/msw/magnif1.cur
  src/msw/ctl3d/*
  utils/glcanvas/samples/isosurf/isosurf.dat.gz

  and re-add them.

- wxDB ODBC classes: it seems that there are too many
  Sybase-specific features for it to work on e.g. MySQL,
  PostgreSQL. Find out what Remstar uses and document
  problems/restrictions.

- In doc/view file selector, document type is selected by
  extension, not the type selected in the (Windows) file selector.

- Complete this ToDo list :-)
