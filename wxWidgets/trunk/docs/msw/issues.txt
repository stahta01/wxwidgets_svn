Current issues and bugs
-----------------------

Memory-checking subsystem
-------------------------

This conflicts with wxUSE_IOSTREAMSH = 0 using MS VC++ 5.0
(crashes the template code). It should be switched off if you
wish to use wxUSE_IOSTREAMSH = 0.

BC++ in 16-bit mode
-------------------

resource.cpp has to be split into two to compile (hence
resourc2.cpp). Unfortunately we still get the error:

        Segment TEXT_RESOURCE exceeds 64K.

The solution is probably to load wxResourceBitListTable
dynamically using LoadString to load the names, and initialize the table
at wxWindows start-up.

Meanwhile the work-around is to switch wxUSE_WX_RESOURCES to 0
(done in setup.h if BC++/16-bit mode is detected).
