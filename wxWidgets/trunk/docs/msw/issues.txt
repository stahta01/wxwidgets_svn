Memory-checking subsystem
-------------------------

This conflicts with wxUSE_IOSTREAMSH = 0 using MS VC++ 5.0
(crashes the template code). It should be switched off if you
wish to use wxUSE_IOSTREAMSH = 0.

Many things seem to be broken for 16-bit Windows, including
dialogs (crash in wxFindWinFromHandle). The generic tree, list
and notebook controls don't work. The generic wxImageList drawing
function doesn't work (wxDC::SelectObject problem).
