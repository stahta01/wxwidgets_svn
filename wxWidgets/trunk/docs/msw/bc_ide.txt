4. How to create IDE-files for your own wxWindows-programs

1. What you can do with this IDE-files
======================================

There are two IDE-files. One IDE-file should help you to create
the wxWindows library from within the Ide of Borlands C++, v.
5.x. The other one should help you to create most of the samples
of wxWindows the same way.

2. Where to install the files
=============================

You should copy the file named wxwin32_lib.IDE to the
src-directory of your wxWindows-Installation (e.g. C:\wxwin\src).
And the other file samples.IDE should be copied into the
samples-directory (e.g. C:\wxwin\samples).

3. How to modify them for your own needs
========================================

If your wxWindows-Installation resIDEs on the same drive as your
Borland-Compiler and additionally the Borland-Installation is
the default (e.g. C:\BC5) then there should be no need to change
anything. Otherwise please change the path from within the IDE
(Options->project->directories). This should be very easy for
the library-file. For the samples-file it can be neccessary to
change the settings for all programms seperately, because there
are local options for each of them. To do that, show the project
so that you can see the list with all the programs, right-click
onto each of them and choose local options. Then change the
directory-names.

4. How to create IDE-files for your own wxWindows-programs
==========================================================

I think you are familiar with the necessary options for your own
program. So I will only describe what is neccessary to link
yout programm with the wxWindows-library. If you want to create
a IDE-file for your own wxWindows-program, create a new project
from the menu file->new->project. Deactivate all the
standard-options, the only two things that should be activated is
"static" for the libraries, if you want to use the library
produced with the library-IDE and the checkbox OLE (You can
leave this checkbox unchecked, but then you have to add the
library \bc5\lib\ole2w32.lib to your project). You have to add
the include-path of wxWindows to the include-path in the
options-dialog (options->project->directories->include). The
result should be something like:
path_of_my_program;\bc5\include;\wxwin2\include; Then you have
to add the libraries to the project. Open the project-view and
activate your programm. Then right-click and choose "add" and
select the wxWindows-library (e.g. \wxwin\lib\wx32.lib).
