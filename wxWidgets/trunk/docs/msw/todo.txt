Todo on wxWin 2, Windows platform
---------------------------------

HIGH PRIORITY
-------------

Add automatic line wrap to wxStaticText

Add centring, right justify styles to wxStaticText.

Extend wxLocale to get more locale settings (currency,
date/time, decimal separator and so on)

LOW PRIORITY (MEDIUM TERM)
--------------------------

Supply VC++ project generator utility.

Add further controls and properties to Dialog Editor.

Write tutorial.

Add wxDC::DeviceToLogical -> wxPoint etc (convenience accessors).

Add GetIcon, GetBitmap to wxImageList. Perhaps store bitmaps
in image list so we can get them later.

Merge dib.cpp, dibutils.cpp (see also some DIB code in bitmap.cpp).

wxCreateDynamicObject is apparently slow: ~ 2000 calls to strcmp. Need to
use some kind of hash table scheme.

Write wxDisplay class for querying settings and passing
to wxFrame to mirror the X situation (multiple displays).

Implement wxDC floating point transformations.

WISH LIST (LONG TERM)
---------------------

ActiveX support

Porting to WinCE

GDI objects could be optimised further in constructors by
searching for a matching, pre-existing object, and assigning from
that, thus sharing the internal handle. A problem with this
arises if you wish to change the data. But this can be handled by
un-refing and creating a new handle. So we could reuse many
Windows GDI objects without troubling the programmer. We might
wish to switch this off in certain circumstances, e.g.

    wxEnableGDIReuse(FALSE);
    wxBrush brush(...);
    wxEnableGDIReuse(TRUE);

or even

    wxGDIReuse reuse(FALSE);
    wxBrush brush(...);

which lasts until its scope ends. This might be needed e.g. if we
needed to ensure that the operation was maximally efficient
(creating a new object rather than searching may or may not be
more efficient).

Integrate Guilhem's multimedia classes: documentation, makefiles,
different platforms.

Rich text class.
