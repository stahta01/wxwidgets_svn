*** About wxWindows

wxWindows is probably the most powerful and comprehensive
open-source, multi-platform C++ GUI framework available, which
can be used to build commercial and free software. It's used by many
organisations all over the world, including the company that
invented the GUI.

For most ports, wxWindows adopts the native look and feel of
each platform since it uses the native widget sets. There is also
a generic widget set, used for the wxX11 port -- no other widget set
is required, giving the potential for embedded use.

An extraordinary range of classes is provided - but don't be put
off by this because most people find wxWindows easier to learn
and use than MFC and other frameworks.

As well as comprehensive support for the usual widgets, advanced
features include: HTML viewing/printing, wxImage class providing
handlers for eading and writing many image types, resizeable panels
and dialogs on all platforms, document/view, OpenGL support,
HTML-based and context-sensitive help, wizards, drag and drop,
a grid class, ODBC support, threads, sockets, container classes,
and much more. An 1800-page reference manual is provided in HTML,
MS HTML Help, WinHelp, wxWindows Help and PDF, and there are over
70 samples and demos.

If you're an MFC user, you'll find many wxWindows concepts
reassuringly familiar, while often clearer and more consistent.
If you're not, you should still find it intuitive from the start.

wxWindows bindings for several other languages are available,
including Python, Perl, Basic, Lua, JavaScript and Eiffel.
