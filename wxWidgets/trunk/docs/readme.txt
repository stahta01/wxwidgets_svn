wxWindows 2.0
-------------

Welcome to wxWindows 2.0, a sophisticated cross-platform C++
framework for writing advanced GUI applications using (where
possible) the native controls.

In addition to common and advanced GUI facilities such as frames, scrolling
windows, toolbars, tree controls, icons, device contexts,
printing, splitter windows and so on, there are wrappers for common
file operations and facilities for writing TCP/IP applications.
Where certain features are not available on a platform, such as MDI and
tree controls on Unix, they are emulated.

A detailed 700-page reference manual is supplied in HTML, PDF and
Windows Help form.

For a quick start, point your Web browser at docs/html/index.htm for a list of
important documents and samples.

Platforms supported
-------------------

wxWindows 2.0 currently supports the following platforms:

- Windows 3.1, Windows 95/98, Windows NT

Installation
------------

wxWindows 2.0 needs to be compiled before you can test out
the samples or write your own applications.
For installation information, please see the install.txt file
in the individual directories:

  docs/msw
  docs/gtk
  docs/motif

Licence information
-------------------

For licensing information, please see the files:

  docs/preamble.txt
  docs/licence.txt
  docs/licendoc.txt
  docs/gpl.txt
  docs/lgpl.txt

Although this may seem complex, it is there to allow authors of
proprietary/commercial applications to use wxWindows in
addition to those writing GPL'ed applications. In summary,
the licence is L-GPL plus a clause allowing unrestricted
distribution of application binaries. To answer a FAQ, you
don't have to distribute any source if you wish to write
commercial applications using wxWindows.
