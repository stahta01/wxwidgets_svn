Enhancements for wxWindows 3.0
==============================

RCS-ID:      $Id$

C++ Features
============

- Namespaces.
- STL containers compatibility (including using STL-like
  adapters for wxWindows containers).
- Exception Handling: making the code exception-safe, and
  also _using_ exceptions throughout the code.

Core
====

- Use wxEventLoop in all builds.
- Remove wxCOMPATIBILITY (1.X).
- Modularization/Build System/Project File Generation.
- A configuration tool to generate setup.h and configure
  commands.
- RTTI native Support, Properties/Member-Metadata, 2-Step Init with
  virtual create: e.g. Create(const wxArrayVariant&).

Documentation
=============

- The possibility of moving doc into header files with tool
  support.
- Detailed review of doc accuracy.
- wxDC : Precise definition of default/initial state. 
- wxDC : Pixelwise definition of operations (e.g. last point of a
  line not drawn).

wxEvents
========

Change Idle Handling
--------------------
Current Implementation is using too many CPU cycles.

Loose Coupling Event-Source Event-Sink
--------------------------------------
Kind of the NextStep/C# very performant coupling, exposing
events via metadata.

Remove Lazy Init of Eventtables
-------------------------------
Was introduced as a bug-fix, not needed anymore, consumes
considerable CPU time.


Modules/Plugins
===============

Architecture
------------

We aim to arrive at a lazy initializiation of modules only when they are first 
needed. Dependency information between modules is needed. Dynamic Plug-In
loading and unloading must be compatible with that.

wxUniversal
===========

- Renderers within native ports.

wxPrinting
==========

- Page preflighting capabilities in order to determine number
  of pages.
- Preview UI enhancement.

wxStaticBox
===========

Hide the platform problems (GTK: 'children' must be siblings) in encapsulation 
in order to avoid problems on ports where the hierarchy must be
'correct'.

Miscellaneous
=============

- wxDC Support for point to char-position with text rendering.
- wxLocale Extension (eg currency).
- wxStreams review.
