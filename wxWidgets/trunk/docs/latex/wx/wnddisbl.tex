\section{\class{wxWindowDisabler}}\label{wxwindowdisabler}

This class disables all windows of the application (may be with the exception
of one of them) in its constructor and enables them back in its destructor.
This comes in handy when you want to indicate to the user that the application
is currently busy and cannot respond to user input.
