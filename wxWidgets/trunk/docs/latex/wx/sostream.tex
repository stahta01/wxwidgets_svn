This class implements an output stream which writes data either to a
user-provided or internally allocated string. Note that currently this stream
does not support seeking.

\membersection{wxStringOutputStream::wxStringOutputStream}

\func{}{wxStringOutputStream}{\param{wxString}{ *str = \texttt{NULL}}}

If the provided pointer is non-\texttt{NULL}, data will be written to it.
Otherwise, an internal string is used for the data written to this stream, use 
\helpref{GetString()}{wxstringoutputstreamgetstring} to get access to it.


\membersection{wxStringOutputStream::GetString}\label{wxstringoutputstreamgetstring}

\constfunc{const wxString\&}{GetString}{\void}

Returns the string containing all the data written to the stream so far.
