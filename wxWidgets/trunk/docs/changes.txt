- Made resource sample use the correct Cancel button id.
- Moved wxProp to main library (generic directory), created proplist
  sample.
- Added bombs and fractal samples.

Beta 1, December 24th 1998
--------------------------

wxGTK:

- Various

wxMSW, wxMotif: not in sync with this release.


Alpha 18, December 29th 1998
----------------------------

wxMSW:

- Win16 support working again (VC++ 1.5)
- Win16 now uses generic wxNotebook, wxListCtrl,
  wxTreeCtrl -- more or less working now, although
  a little work on wxNotebook is still needed.
  Under 16-bit Windows, get assertion when you click
  on a tab.
- Wrote 16-bit BC++ makefiles: samples don't yet link.
- Added CodeWarrior support to distribution courtesy
  of Stefan Csomor.

wxMotif:

- Cured scrolling problem: scrollbars now show/hide themselves
  without (permanently) resizing the window.
- Removed some commented-out lines in wxScrolledWindow::AdjustScrollbars
  that disabled scrollbar paging.
- Set background colour of drawing area in wxWindow, so e.g. wxListCtrl
  colours correctly.
- Removed major bug whereby dialogs were unmanaged automatically
  when any button was pressed.
- Fixed colours of wxWindow scrollbars, made list and text controls
  have a white background.
- Fixed dialog colour setting.
- Added settable fonts and colours for wxMenu/wxMenuBar. Now
  they have sensible colours by default.
- Fixed a bug in wxStaticBox.
- Cured wxTreeCtrl bug: now works pretty well!
- Debugged DrawEllipticArc (a ! in the wrong place).
- Added SetClippingRegion( const wxRegion& region ).
- Added wxPoint, wxSize, wxRect versions of SetSize etc.

Alpha 17, November 22nd 1998
----------------------------

wxMSW:

- More documentation updates, especially for
  wxLayoutWindow classes and debugging facilities.
- Changed wxDebugContext to use wxDebugLog instead
  of wxTrace.
- Now supports VC++ 6.0, and hopefully BC++ 5.0.
  However, DLL support may be broken for BC++ since
  VC++ 6 required changing of WXDLLEXPORT keyword
  position.
- Numerous miscellaneous changes.

wxMotif:

- Reimplemented MDI using wxNotebook instead of the MDI widgets, which
  were too buggy (probably not design for dynamic addition/removal of
  child frames).
- Some improvements to the wxNotebook implementation.
- wxToolBar now uses a bulletin board instead of a form, in an attempt
  to make it possible to add ordinary wxControls to a toolbar.
- Cured problem with not being able to use global memory operators,
  by defining two more global operators, so that the delete will match
  the debugging implementation.
- Added wxUSE_DEBUG_NEW_ALWAYS so we can distinguish between using
  global memory operators (usually OK) and #defining new to be
  WXDEBUG_NEW (sometimes it might not be OK).
- Added time.cpp to makefile; set wxUSE_DATETIME to 1.
- Added a parent-existance check to popup menu code to make it not crash.
- Added some optimization in wxWindow::SetSize to produce less flicker.
  It remains to be seen whether this produces any resize bugs.

It's a long time since I updated this file. Previously done:

- wxFrame, wxDialog done.
- wxScrolledWindow done (but backing pixmap not used at present).
- wxBitmap done though could be tidied it up at some point.
- Most basic controls are there, if not rigorously tested.
- Some MDI support (menus appear on child frames at present).
- wxNotebook almost done.
- wxToolBar done (horizontal only, which would be easy to extend
  to vertical toolbars).

More recently:

- Colour and font changing done (question mark over what happens
  to scrollbars).
- Accelerators done (for menu items and buttons). Also event loop
  tidied up in wxApp so that events are filtered through ProcessXEvent.
- wxWindow::GetUpdateRegion should now work.

Alpha 16, September 8th 1998
----------------------------

wxMSW:

- Added wxSashWindow, wxSashLayoutWindow classes, and sashtest
  sample.
- Guilhem's socket classes added, plus wxsocket sample.
- A few more makefiles added.
- GnuWin32/BC++ compatibility mods.
- Further doc updates.
- wxProp updates for correct working with wxGTK.

wxMotif:

- First start at Motif port.
- Made makefiles for wxMotif source directory and minimal sample.
- First go at wxApp, wxWindow, wxDialog, wxPen, wxBrush, wxFont,
  wxColour, wxButton, wxCheckBox, wxTextCtrl, wxStaticText,
  wxMenu, wxMenuItem, wxMenuBar

Alpha 15, August 31st 1998
--------------------------

wxMSW:

- wxBitmap debugged.
- wxDC::GetDepth added.
- Contribution added whereby wxBitmap will be
  converted to DC depth if they don't match.
- wxConfig API improved, documentation updated.
- Printing classes name conventions cleaned up.
- wxUpdateUIEvent now derives from wxCommandEvent
  so event can travel up the window hierachy.

Alpha 14, July 31st 1998
------------------------

wxMSW:

- Toolbar API has been simplified, and now
  wxFrame::GetClientArea returns the available client
  area when toolbar, status bar etc. have been accounted for.
  wxFrame::CreateToolBar added in line with CreateStatusBar.
- Documentation updates, incl. for wxToolBar.
- New wxAcceleratorTable class plus wxFrame::SetAcceleratorTable.
- Various additions from other folk, e.g. streams, wxConfig
  changes, wxNotebook.
- Added wxDocMDIParentFrame, wxDocMDIChildFrame for doc/view.

Alpha 13, July 8th 1998
-----------------------

wxMSW:

- Implemented wxPoint as identical to POINT on Windows, and
  altered wxDC wxPoint functions to use wxPoint directly in
  Windows functions, for efficiency.
- Cured wxASSERT bug in wxStatusBar95.
- #ifdefed out some bits in oleutils.cpp for compilers that
  don't support it.
- Added some operators to wxPoint, wxSize.
- Added inline wxDC functions using wxPoint, wxSize, wxRect.

Alpha 12, July 7th 1998
-----------------------

wxMSW:

- Added wxApp::GetComCtl32Version, and wxTB_FLAT style, so can
  have flat toolbars on Win98 or Win95 with IE >= 3 installed.

Alpha 11, July 3rd 1998
-----------------------

wxMSW:

- Added thread.h, thread.cpp.
- Changed Enabled, Checked to IsEnabled, IsChecked in wxMenu,
  wxMenuBar.
- Changed wxMenuItem::SetBackColor to SetBackgroundColour,
  SetTextColor to SetTextColour, and added or made public several
  wxMenuItem accessors.
- Added two overloads to wxRegion::Contains. Added
  wxRegion::IsEmpty for a more consistent naming convention.
- Added Vadim's wxDataObject and wxDropSource.
- ENTER/LEAVE events now work.
- Cured wxMemoryDC bug where the DC wasn't being deleted.
- Cured wxGauge SetSize major bugginess.
- Cured problem where if a GDI object was created on the stack,
  then went out of scope, then another object was selected into
  the DC, GDI objects would leak. This is because the assignment
  to e.g. wxDC::m_pen would delete the GDI object without it first
  being selected out of the DC. Cured by selecting the old DC object
  first, then doing the assignment.
- Split up wxGaugeMSW, wxGauge95, wxSliderMSW, wxSlider95
- Various other bug fixes and additions.

Generic:

- Major work on Dialog Editor (still plenty to go).
- Expanded documentation a bit more.

Alpha 10, May 7th 1998
----------------------

wxMSW:

- Added desiredWidth, desiredHeight parameters to wxBitmapHandler
  and wxIcon functions so that you can specify what size of
  icon should be loaded. Probably will remain a Windows-specific thing.
- wxStatusBar95 now works for MDI frames.
- Toolbars in MDI frames now behave normally. They still
  require application-supplied positioning code though.
- Changed installation instructions, makefiles and batch files
  for compiling with Gnu-Win32/Mingw32/EGCS. Also timercmn.cpp
  change to support Mingw32/EGCS. Bison now used by default.

Alpha 9, April 27th 1998
------------------------

wxMSW:

- Cured bug in wxStatusBar95 that caused a crash if multiple
  fields were used.
- Added Gnu-Win32 b19/Mingw32 support by changing resource
  compilation and pragmas.
- Cured wxMenu bug introduced in alpha 8 - didn't respond to
  commands because VZ changed the id setting in wxMenu::MSWCommand.

Generic:

- Corrected some bugs, such as the wxModule compilation problem.
- Added Gnu-Win32 b19/Mingw32 support by changing resource
  compilation and pragmas.

  of modules to be initialized and cleaned up on wxWindows
  startup/exit.
- Start of Mingw32 compatibility (see minimal and dialogs samples
  makefile.m95 files, and install.txt).
- Note: Windows printing has stopped working... will investigate.

Alpha 7, March 30th 1998
------------------------

wxMSW:

- Added tab classes, tab sample.
- Now can return FALSE from OnInit and windows will be
  cleaned up properly before exit.
- Improved border handling so panels don't get borders
  automatically.
- Debugged MDI activation from Window menu.
- Changes to memory debug handling, including checking for
  memory leaks on application exit - but see issues.txt for
  unresolved issues.
- Added wxTaskBarIcon (taskbar.cpp/h, plus samples/taskbar)
  to allow maintenance of an icon in the Windows 95 taskbar
  tray area.
- Got MFC sample working (MFC and wxWindows in the same
  application), partly by tweaking ntwxwin.mak settings.
- Got DLL compilation working again (VC++).
- Changed wxProp/Dialog Editor filenames.

Generic:

- Added tab classes, tab sample.
- Revised memory.cpp, memory.h slightly; memory.h now #defines
  new to WXDEBUG_NEW in DEBUG mode. Windows implementation app.cpp
  now checks for leaks on exit. Added memcheck sample.
  See src/msw/issues.txt for more details.
- resource.h, resource.cpp changed to make wxDefaultResourceTable
  a pointer. Now initialize resource system with
  wxInitializeResourceSystem and wxCleanUpResourceSystem, to
  allow better control of memory.
- wxString now derives from wxObject, to enable memory leak
  checking.
- Added some #include fixes in various files, plus changed
  float to long in wxToolBar files.

Alpha 6, March 10th 1998
------------------------

wxMSW:

- Found stack error bug - stopped unwanted OnIdle recursion.
- Removed bug in wxTreeCtrl::InsertItem I added in alpha 5.
- Changed exit behaviour in wxApp/wxFrame/wxDialog. Now will
  check if the number of top-level windows is zero before
  exiting. Also, wxApp::GetTopWindow will return either
  m_topWindow or the first member of wxTopLevelWindows, so you
  don't have to call wxApp::SetTopWindow.
- Added dynarray.h/dynarray.cpp (from Vadim).
- Added first cut at OLE drag and drop (from Vadim). dnd sample
  added. Drop target only at this stage. See src/msw/ole/*.cpp,
  wx/include/msw/ole/*.h. WIN32 only because of UUID usage.
  Doesn't work with GnuWin32 - no appropriate headers e.g. for
  IUnknown.
  Doesn't work with BC++ either - crashes on program startup.
- Added Vadim's owner-draw modifications - will probably remain
  Windows-only. This enhances wxMenu, wxListBox. See ownerdrw sample.
- Added wxLB_OWNERDRAW for owner-draw listboxes.
- Vadim's wxCheckListBox derives from wxListBox. See checklst sample.
  Doesn't entirely work for WIN16.
- Vadim has added wxMenuItem as a separate file menuitem.cpp. It
  can also be used as an argument to wxMenu::Append, not just for
  internal implementation.
- Some #ifdefs done for MINGW32 compilation (just alter OPTIONS
  in makeg95.env, together with mingw32.bat). However, resource
  binding is not working yet so most apps with dialogs crash.

Generic:

- Added Vadim's dynarray.h, dynarray.cpp.
- Added Vadim's menuitem.cpp.
- Added Windows-specific wxCheckListBox,
  owner-draw wxListBox, and drag-and-drop
  (see docs/msw/changes.txt).

Alpha 5, 14th February 1998
--------------------------

wxMSW:

- GENERIC AND MSW-SPECIFIC CODE NOW TREATED AS TWO SEPARATE
  DISTRIBUTIONS. This change log will therefore now refer to
  the Windows-specific code only. See docs/changes.txt for generic
  changes.
- Removed Windows-specific reference counting system (GDI
  resources were cleaned up in idle time) - minimal
  advantages now we have a wxWin reference counting system.
- Added missing WXDLLEXPORT keywords so DLL compilation works
  again.
- Removed most warnings for GnuWin32 compilation.
- Added wxRegion/wxRegionIterator, but haven't yet used it in
  e.g. wxDC.

Generic:

- GENERIC AND MSW-SPECIFIC CODE NOW TREATED AS TWO SEPARATE
  DISTRIBUTIONS. This change log will therefore now refer to
  the generic code only. See docs/msw/changes.txt for Windows-specific
  changes.
- Readmes, change logs and installation files now go in
  platform-specific directories under docs, e.g. docs/msw,
  docs/gtk.
- Added DECLARE_APP and IMPLEMENT_APP macros so wxApp object gets
  created dynamically, not as a global object.
- Put wxColour into wx/msw/colour.h, src/msw/colour.cpp.
- Changed names of some include/wx/generic headers to be
  consistent and to conform to gcc pragma conventions. Also
  changed choicesg.cpp to choicdgg.cpp.
- Added gcc pragmas.
- Added gtk inclusion in include/wx headers.
- Added consistent file headings to source and headers.
- Removed lang.cpp, lang.h and references to wxSTR_... variables;
  added a few references to wxTransString.
- Added operator to wxTransString that converts automatically
  to wxString, so we can say e.g. wxMessageBox(wxTransString("Hello"), ...).
- samples/internat now works (minimally).
- Added wxMouseEvent::GetPosition and
  wxMouseEvent::GetLogicalPosition, both returning wxPoints.
- Made wxSize and wxRect contain longs not ints.
- Cured some lemory leaks (thanks Vadim).
- Tidied up OnIdle and introduced RequestMore/MoreRequested so
  will only keep processing OnIdle if it returns TRUE from
  MoreRequested.

Alpha 4, 31st January 1998
--------------------------

All:

- Changed wxDC functions to take longs instead of floats. GetSize now takes
  integer pointers, plus a version that returns a wxSize.
- const keyword added to various wxDC functions.
- Under Windows, wxDC no longer has any knowledge of whether
  an associated window is scrolled or not. Instead, the device
  origin is set by wxScrolledWindow in wxScrolledWindow::PrepareDC.
- wxScrolledWindow applications can optionally override the virtual OnDraw
  function instead of using the OnPaint event handler. The wxDC passed to
  OnDraw will be translated by PrepareDC to reflect scrolling.
  When drawing outside of OnDraw, must call PrepareDC explicitly.
- wxToolBarBase/wxToolBarSimple similarly changed to allow for
  scrolling toolbars.
- Integrated wxPostScriptDC patches for 1.xx by Chris Breeze,
  to help printing with multiple pages.
- IPC classes given base classes (wxConnectionBase etc.) which
  define the API used by different implementations. DDE
  implementation updated to use these base classes.
- wxHelpInstance now separated into wxHelpControllerBase (base
  for all implementations), wxWinHelpController (uses standard
  WinHelp), wxXLPHelPController (talks to wxHelp by DDE or
  TCP/IP). There will be others eventually, such as
  wxHTMLHelpController for Microsoft (and Netscape?) HTML Help.
- Added Vadim Zeitlin's wxString class plus
  internationalization code (gettext simulation, wxLocale, etc.).
  New files from Vadim:
  include\wx\string.h
  include\wx\debug.h
  include\wx\file.h
  include\wx\log.h
  include\wx\intl.h
  src\common\string.cpp
  src\common\log.cpp
  src\common\intl.cpp
  src\common\file.cpp
  No longer use GNU wxString files.
- Split off file-related functions into include\wx\filefn.h and
  src\common\filefn.cpp.
- Borland C++ support (WIN32) for main library and
  samples, using makefile.b32 files.
- Preparation done for allowing BC++ to compile wxWin as a DLL,
  including changes to defs.h.
- wxIntPoint removed, wxPoint is now int, and wxRealPoint
  introduced.
- Added wxShowEvent (generated when window is being shown or
  hidden).
- Got minimal, docview, mdi samples working for 16-bit VC++ and
  cured 16-bit problem with wxTextCtrl (removed global memory
  trick).
- Updated GnuWin32 makefiles, checked minimal, mdi, docview samples.

Alpha 3, September 1997
-----------------------

All:

- wxListCtrl, wxTreeCtrl, wxImageList classes done.
- Instigated new file hierarchy, split files and classes up more logically.
- PrologIO and some other utils now put into core library.
- Revamped print/preview classes, added wxPageSetupDialog.
- Started documentation.

Alpha 2, 30th April 1997
------------------------

All:

- EVT_... macros now have at least one argument, for conformance
  with MetroWerks compiler.
- Added ids to .wxr file format.
- Got Dialog Editor compiled and running again but need
  to extend functionality to be in line with new controls.
  Added dialoged\test app to allow dynamic loading of .wxr files
  for testing purposes.
- Rewrote wxBitmap to allow installable file type
  handlers.
- Rewrote wxBitmapButton, wxStaticBitmap to not use Fafa.
- Wrote most of wxTreeCtrl and sample (need wxImageList to implement it
  fully).
- Added back wxRadioBox.
- Tidied up wx_main.cpp, wxApp class, putting PenWin code in
  a separate file.

Alpha 1, 5th April 1997
-----------------------

Generic:

At this point, the following has been achieved:

- A lot, but not all, of the code has been revamped for better
  naming conventions, protection of data members, and use of
  wxString instead of char *.
- Obsolete functionality deleted (e.g. default wxPanel layout,
  old system event system) and code size reduced.
- Class hierarchy changed (see design doc) - base classes such
  as wxbWindow now removed.
- No longer includes windows.h in wxWin headers, by using stand-in
  Windows types where needed e.g. WXHWND.
- PrologIO revised.
- wxScrolledWindow, wxStatusBar and new MDI classes added.
  MDI is now achived using separate classes, not window styles.
- wxSystemSettings added, and made use of to reflect standard
  Windows settings.
- SetButtonFont/SetLabelFont replaced by SetFont; font and colour
  settings mucho rationalised.
- All windows are now subclassed with the same window proc to make
  event handling far more consistent. Old internal wxWnd and derived
  classes removed.
- API for controls revised, in particular addition of
  wxValidator parameters and removal of labels for some controls.
- 1 validator written: see examples/validate.
- Event table system introduced (see most samples and
  wx_event.cpp/ProcessEvent, wx_event.h). wxEvtHandler
  made more flexible, with Push/PopEventHandler allowing a chain
  of event handlers.
- wxRadioBox removed - will be added back soon.
- Toolbar class hierarchy revised:
  wxToolBarBase
  wxToolBarSimple (= old wxToolBar)
  wxToolBar95 (= old wxButtonBar under Win95
  wxToolBarMSW (= old wxButtonBar under WIN16/WIN32)
- Constraint system debugged somewhat (sizers now work properly).
- wxFileDialog, wxDirDialog added; other common dialogs now
  have class equivalents. Generic colour and font dialogs
  rewritten to not need obsolete panel layout.
- .wxr resource system partially reinstated, though needs
  an integer ID for controls. Hopefully the resource system
  will be replaced by something better and more efficient
  in the future.
- Device contexts no longer stored with window and accessed
  with GetDC - use wxClientDC, wxPaintDC, wxWindowDC stack
  variables instead.
- wxSlider uses trackbar class under Win95, and wxSL_LABELS flag
  determines whether labels are shown. Other Win95-specific flags
  introduced, e.g. for showing ticks.
- Styles introduced for dealing with 3D effects per window, for
  any window: all Win95 3D effects supported, plus transparent windows.
- Major change to allow 3D effect support without CTL3D, under
  Win95.
- Bitmap versions of button and checkbox separated out into new
  classes, but unimplemented as yet because I intend to remove
  the need for Fafa - it apparently causes GPFs in Win95 OSR 2.
- utils/wxprop classes working (except maybe wxPropertyFormView)
  in preparation for use in Dialog Editor.
- GNU-WIN32 compilation verified (a month or so ago).
