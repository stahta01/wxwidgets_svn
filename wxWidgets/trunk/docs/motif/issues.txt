Outstanding issues
------------------

(see also todo.txt)

- wxTreeCtrl, wxListCtrl need some debugging (probably mostly
  wxMotif scrolling issues).
- wxTextCtrl doesn't work as a stream buffer in Linux/gcc
- No wxSpinButton
- Need a way of specifying default settings for colour/font/etc.
- More optimisation could be done to reduce X server traffic, etc.
