wxWindows 2.0 for Motif installation
------------------------------------

- Prerequisites: Motif 1.2 or above, or Lesstif
  (not yet tested). Motif 2.0 and above may also be suitable.

- Download the files wx200gen.zip and wx200mot.zip, and
  documentation in a preferred format, such as wx200htm.zip
  or wx200pdf.zip.

- Make a directory such as ~/wx and unzip the files into this
  directory. Use the -a option if available to convert the ASCII
  files to Unix format. Don't worry about files being
  overwritten: they should be identical anyway.

COMPILING USING CONFIGURE

- You can use the wxGTK configure system to make wxMotif, or
  you can follow the following steps to use the simpler (but
  less automatic) makefile system. If using configure, the
  following script should make the library and samples, when
  run from the top-level wxWindows directory (see also 'makewx'
  in this directory):

  # Make wxMotif using the configure system
  chmod a+x configure config.sub setup/general/* config.guess setup/shared/*
  ./configure --with-shared --with-motif --with-debug_flag \
   --with-debug_info --without-threads
  make

COMPILING USING MAKEFILES

- Choose a .env file from src/makeenvs that matches your
  environment, and copy it to src/make.env. These are the
  settings read by wxWindows for Motif makefiles.

- Edit src/make.env to change options according to your local
  environment. In particular, change WXDIR to where wxWindows is
  found on your system, or set the WXWIN environment variable
  before compilation, e.g.:

    export WXWIN=/home/jacs/wx2

  Later, there will be a better makefile system
  and/or alternate make.env files as per wxWindows 1.68.
  Please feel free to contribute settings files for your environment.

- Change directory to src/motif and type:

    make -f makefile.unx motif

  This should make the library libwx_motif.a in the lib
  directory.

- Make a sample, such as the minimal sample:

    cd samples/minimal
    make -f makefile.unx motif

  and run the resulting minimal_motif binary.

Notes:
------

- Better installation and makefile systems are
  required. Although the wxGTK config system can be used to make
  wxMotif and samples, it can't easily be made to work
  with applications outside the wxWindows hierarchy. Hence the
  simple makefile system.

- Debugging mode is switched on by default. To compile in non-debug
  mode, remove the -D__WXDEBUG__ switch in make.env.

- Some classes can be switched off in include/wx/motif/setup.h,
  if you are having trouble with a particular file. However,
  I'd prefer you to fix the problem and send the fix to me :-) or at
  least let me know about it.

- Thread support is switched off by default in setup.h (wxUSE_THREADS)
  because standard Unices often do not have the necessary thread library
  installed. Please see ../docs/gtk/install.txt for more details on this.
  For Linux, the problem is expected to go away with future
  distributions of the operating system.

- If you have trouble compiling the file y_tab.c, or have strange
  linking errors, check whether you're using a C or C++ compiler for this file.
  You should specify a C compiler in the CCLEX variable in src/make.env.

- If you run into problems with a missing X11/Xpm.h header, you
  need to install the XPM package. It can be obtained from:

  ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/libraries/xpm-3.4k.tar.gz
  http://sunfreeware.com

  You may need to modify make.env to add -I and -L options pointing to where Xpm
  is installed and possibly change bitmap.cpp to
  include <xpm.h> instead of <X11/xpm.h>

  Alternatively, edit include/motif/setup.h, set wxUSE_XPM
  to 0, and recompile. You will not be able to load any XPMs,
  though (currently the only supported colour bitmap format).

- Please send bug reports with a description of your environment,
  compiler and the error message(s) to the wxwin-users mailing list at:

    wxwin-users@wx.dent.med.uni-muenchen.de
