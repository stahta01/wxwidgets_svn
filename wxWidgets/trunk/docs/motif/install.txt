wxWindows 2.0 for Motif installation
------------------------------------

- Prerequisites: Motif 1.2 or above, or
  Lesstif (not yet tested).

- Download the files wx200gen.zip and wx200mot.zip, and
  documentation in a preferred format, such as wx200htm.zip
  or wx200pdf.zip.

- Make a directory such as ~/wx and unzip the files into this
  directory. Use the -a option if available to convert the ASCII
  files to Unix format. Don't worry about files being
  overwritten: they should be identical anyway.

- Edit src/make.env to change options according to your local
  environment. In particular, change WXDIR to where wxWindows is
  found on your system.
  Later, there will be a better makefile system
  and/or alternate make.env files as per wxWindows 1.68.
  Please feel free to contribute settings files for your environment.

- Change directory to src/motif and type:

    make -f makefile.unx motif

  This should make the library libwx_motif.a in the lib
  directory.

- Make a sample, such as the minimal sample:

    cd samples/minimal
    make -f makefile.unx motif

  and run the resulting minimal_motif binary.

Notes:
------

- Better installation and makefile systems are
  required. I didn't use the wxGTK system because I couldn't
  understand it or make it work with wxMotif. Also I think
  we should use something that can be made to work easily
  with applications outside the wxWindows hierarchy.

- Debugging mode is switched on by default. To compile in non-debug
  mode, remove the -D__WXDEBUG__ switch in make.env.

- Some classes can be switched off in include/wx/motif/setup.h,
  if you are having trouble with a particular file. However,
  I'd prefer you to fix the problem and send the fix to me :-) or at
  least let me know about it.

- Please send bug reports with a description of your environment,
  compiler and the error message(s) to the wxwin-users mailing list at:

    wxwin-users@wx.dent.med.uni-muenchen.de
