  Welcome to wxWindows/Wine 2.1 snapshot 7,

you have downloaded version 2.1 of the WINE port of 
the wxWindows GUI library. This is a developers release
and is it not suited for production development. Beware
that major changes can happen before a final release.

More information is available from my homepage at:

  http://wesley.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~wxxt
  
and about the wxWindows project as a whole (and the
Windows and Motif ports in particular) can be found
at Julian Smart's homepage at:

  http://web.ukonline.co.uk/julian.smart/wxwin
  
Information on how to install can be found in the file
INSTALL.txt.

When you run into problems, please read the INSTALL.txt and
follow those instructions. If you still don't have any success,
please send a bug report to one of our mailing lists (see
my homepage) INCLUDING A DESCRIPTION OF YOUR SYSTEM AND 
YOUR PROBLEM, SUCH AS YOUR VERSION OF THE WINE SOURCES, WHAT
DISTRIBUTION YOU USE AND WHAT ERROR WAS REPORTED. I know 
this has no effect, but I tried...

The library produced by the install process will be called 
libwx_mse.a (static) and libwx_msw-2.1.so.0.0.0 (shared) so that 
once a binary incompatible version of wxWindows/Gtk comes out 
we'll augment the library version number to avoid linking problems.

Please send problems concerning installation, feature requests, 
bug reports or comments to the wxWindows users list. Information 
on how to subscribe is available from my homepage.

wxWindows/Wine doesn't come with any guarantee whatsoever. It might 
crash your harddisk or destroy your monitor. It doesn't claim to be
suitable for any special or general purpose.

  Regards,
