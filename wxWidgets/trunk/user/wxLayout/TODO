BUGS
=====================================================================

- Delete():
  1 - occasionally delete deletes too much, maybe when at begin of
      line?
  2 - when in an empty line, Delete() doesn't always merge lines
  3 - line numbers aren't updated properly, may be related to 2.
  4 - deleting lines leaves later parts of the list unaffected
       --> just redrawing at least the next two lines doesn't seem
           enough, strange, don't positions change?
- dmalloc shows duplicate deletion after merging two lines and
  deleting the second half

TODO
=====================================================================

- Add word wrap to wxlwindow/wxllist.
- Cursor to mouseclick
- Focus feedback for cursor
- Selections

- More optimisations
