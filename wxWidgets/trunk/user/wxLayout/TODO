BUGS
=====================================================================

- dmalloc shows duplicate deletion after merging two lines and
  deleting the second half

- word wrap for objects with lots of non-space needs to search in positive
  direction if begin of first object is reached

  - delete in empty line doesn't always work
  - fix initial scrollbar sizes
  - fix horiz scrollbar size


TODO
=====================================================================

  - UNDO!!
  - replacement of llist in window
  - selection highlighting is a bit broken
Improve speed! (See layout problem below!)

  - wxlwindow needs to shrink scrollbar range when window contents get removed
  - When selecting with the mouse, scroll window if pointer is outside.

The following two probs can probably be fixed by adding the
RecalculateLayout() method:
Funny re-layout shows again in sample text.
(Gone after calling layout for all objects before drawing one.)
 Printing works again, but layout at begin of new page is corrupted.


- The import of a private data object does not work yet, we need to get
  the objects back from the string.
- Changing default settings in Clear() or changing/inserting/deleting
  a wxLayoutObject needs to update the m_StyleInfo in all lines, only
  then can we start using that one.
  
- update rectangle (needs support in wxllist and wxWindows)
  --> needs a bit of fixing still
      some code bits are commented out in wxlwindow.cpp
      offset handling seems a bit dodgy, white shadow to top/left of cursor

  - DragNDrop

  - Update docs, do full rtf/html editing. 
  - Verify html export.
