BUGS
=====================================================================

- dmalloc shows duplicate deletion after merging two lines and
  deleting the second half

- word wrap for objects with lots of non-space needs to search in positive
  direction if begin of first object is reached

  - delete in empty line doesn't always work
  - fix initial scrollbar sizes
  - fix horiz scrollbar size
  - occasionally wraps lines wongly (twice) ??

TODO
=====================================================================
- replacement of llist in window
- undo

- Selections!!!

- More optimisations:

- let each line have a pointer to the last layoutcommand and let that
  one only store the settings that changed, then we no longer need to
  recalculate all the lines

  - update rectangle (needs support in wxllist and wxWindows)

- fix(simplify) cursor size calculation: don't use icon cursor if there
  is no cursor object

  - copy/cut/selections
  - UNDO

- cut&paste (paste is there but broken in wxGTK)
  The current paste in wxGTK is broken, support is there.
  Once selections are there, add copy (trivial).

- DragNDrop (waiting for wxGTK/gtk1.2 & GNOME 1.0 / Debian Slink)
