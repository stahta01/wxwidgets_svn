  * Fixed parser.y for Alpha builds (#82949)
  * changed mesa dependency to the virtual libgl package and
    added Conflicts for the old 2.1 packages (which are now
    gone from woody anyway)  Closes: #80120, #70778, #70779, #70780

    so removed the libwxgtk-python-contrib package

    and cache the results of configure tests for all packages.

wxwindows2.2 (2.2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * wxWin 2.2.1 stable release.
  * First upload to deb.org after repackaging to build directly from
    upstream cvs.
  * still not quite lintian clean yet:
    - wxPython lib can't be built with a proper soname yet.
    - the -dbg packages need an override for the shlib symlink.
    - and a couple of packages have the lib symlink 'before the
      lib', but that's ugly to fix right now, they aren't critical
      libs, and allegedly this will be handled by dpkg sometime soon.
  * moved full licence text into copyright file.
