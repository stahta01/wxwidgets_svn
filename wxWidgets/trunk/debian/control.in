Description: wxWindows Cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit (wxPython binding)
 wxWindows is a class library for C++ providing GUI (Graphical User
 Interface) and other facilities on more than one platform.  Version =V
 currently supports subsets of GTK+, Motif, and MS Windows.
 .
 This package provides a Python binding to the wxGTK debug library.
 It is useful for developers as many common errors may be caught.
 Unfortunately it cannot be installed at the same time as the release
 packages, but it will replace them for other applications that require
 wxPython.  You should _never_ upload packages to Debian that depend upon
 this package explicitly, use the libwxgtk=V.=SO-python package instead.
 .
 If you wish to use xrced you'll also need the python-xml package installed.
