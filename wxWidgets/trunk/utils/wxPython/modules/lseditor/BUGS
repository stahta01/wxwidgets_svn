Known bugs

html, all:
        - keys can move the vertical scrollbar, but the window moveth not.
        problem in wxHTML.

        - widgets are not removed when the HTML contents is changed
        (this can be fixed by adding ~HtmlWidgetCell { wnd->Destroy(); } )

        - potential problem with the use of ThreadState in html.i
        (mainly because I don't really know what I'm doing there)

html, msw:
        - vertical scrollbar behaves erratically when content smaller than
        window

        - page with widgets takes forever to draw when constructed
        in frame constructor

html, gtk:
        - segfault on exit; sometimes warning about assert failure
        (m_Object->refcount > 0)


editor, all:
        - (missing feature, really) syntax highlighting data is
        compile time.
