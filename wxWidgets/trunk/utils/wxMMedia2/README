This is the wxMultimedia package. It intends to be a portable way to access
some multimedia component on variable system. For the moment, I implemented
sound, video and CD access.

Sound features:
  * low level/OSS style access to the sound card. You can open/setup the
    parameters of the sound card then write/read directly to/from it.
  * mid level codecs: compressors and sound codec are supported. For the
    moment there is a support for G711/G721/G723 and MULAW formats (as well
    PCM).
  * high level format: WAV file format is supported in read/write and AIFF
    format in read only


Sound bugs:
  * it seems there are still some bugs in the recording code on Windows
    on Cygwin B20.1 (to be verified)
  * wave files created with wxSoundWave have some problem with Windows Media
    Player (not windows recorder)
 
Video features:
  * high level video file playing: on Unix you can play (through xanim) video
    files directly into your application
  * MPEG video file to be supported through SMPEG as soon as I have some free
    time

Video bugs:
  * AVI file works on Windows

CD features:
  * standard access to the CDAUDIO interface

CD bugs:

You need to move the three files included in this directory:
  - utilsunx.cpp => src/unix
  - process.cpp => src/common
  - process.h => include/wx
