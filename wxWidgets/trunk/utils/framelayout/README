This is Aleksandras Gluchovas' framelayout library.

Please read this file for information on compiling and reporting bugs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORGANIZATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

/src contains the library source. The default makefile will create a
(shared) library, for example wx_fl_gtk.so.0.1. 

/samples contains (so far) three samples, ingeniously called 'sample',
'test' and 'demo'. 

Each dir also contains an Unix Makefile.in for automatic makefile generation
for configure, but so far it's not automatic :-)
Instead, a shell script make_Linux_make is provided for this. It should be
trivial to adapt this for other systems that use a configure build.

/samples/bitmaps contains bitmaps that are needed by the samples.

YOU NEED TO RUN THE SAMPLES FROM THIS BITMAP DIR otherwise the binaries
can't find their pics and horrible things will ensue.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUILDING
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

for Unix-like systems: 

./configure should have set things up nicely in the src dir. Just type make
; make install to build and install the library.

to make the samples, run samples/make_Linux_make, then type make in each
sample dir. Non-Linux users should tweak the make_Linux_make script first.

Note that a fl has not been tested with wxMotif yet...

for Windows systems:

The src directory contains a few untested makefiles. Pick one, and best of
luck! 

NOTE: src/Makefile.vc has been tested and works well. (Russell)

<Added 3-11-99>
The samples directory and subdirectories contain (tested) Makefile.vc files 
for use with Visual C++. Move to the samples directory and type 
nmake -f Makefile.vc to build. Alternatively you can enter each sample
directory (demo,sample, etc) and run the command there to build the 
individual sample.

BUGS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Aleksandras' (alex@soften.ktu.lt) has set up a web bug tracking system at

http://devel.soften.ktu.lt:17000/fl_stuff.prj

If you think the wxwindows developers might be interested as well, send a
mail to the list: 

wxwin-developers@wx.dent.med.uni-muenchen.de

For questions/remarks about the organization of files and similar stuff you
can also contact me at H.v.d.Heijden@phys.tue.nl

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ONE MORE WARNING
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've no experience with the Windows version, but X/GTK users beware! It's
not entirely impossible that the samples will crash your X-server, so save
important data in other apps before you start messing with this stuff!

Subject: [wxwin-dev] fl-progress.

Hello,

just uploaded latest frame-layout stuff to:

http://soften.ktu.lt/~alex/newest/fl_src_3_4.zip

and shots to

http://soften.ktu.lt/~alex/newest/fl_3_linux.gif 
http://soften.ktu.lt/~alex/newest/fl_3_nt.gif

Makefiles are currently for wxGtk (cannot write them
for windows compilers that easily), but the same
source code compiles and runs with MSVC (4.0) as well.

There are three samples included:

fl_test   - shows off functionality of new plugins.
fl_sample - may serve as an fl programming-example.
fl_demo   - more complex one, code adopted form the very first demo 
            that i've released 2months ago.

(and manual.html, which is kind of useless at the moment)

huh, singing off for 2days now...

Best Regards,

Aleksandras
