overview = """\
This class provides the file selection dialog. It incorporates OS-native features
depending on the OS in use, and can be used both for open and save operations. 
The files displayed can be filtered by setting up a wildcard filter, multiple files
can be selected (open only), and files can be forced in a read-only mode.

There are two ways to get the results back from the dialog. GetFiles() returns only
the file names themselves, in a Python list. GetPaths() returns the full path and 
filenames combined as a Python list.

One important thing to note: if you use the file extension filters, then files saved
with the filter set to something will automatically get that extension appended to them
if it is not already there. For example, suppose the dialog was displaying the 'egg'
extension and you entered a file name of 'fried'. It would be saved as 'fried.egg.'
Yum!
