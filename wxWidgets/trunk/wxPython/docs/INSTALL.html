<h1 class="title">Installing wxPython 2.5 from Source</h1>
<p>This document will describe the few differences and additions to the
content in BUILD.txt for installing wxPython built from source.
Please follow the intstructions both in this file and in BUILD.txt to
perform this task.  Where there is overlap the items described here
will take precedence.</p>
<div class="section" id="installing-on-unix-like-systems-not-os-x">
<h1><a name="installing-on-unix-like-systems-not-os-x">Installing on Unix-like Systems (not OS X)</a></h1>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">When building wxWindows you need to decide if you want it to be a
private copy only accessed by wxPython, or if you would like it to
be installed in a stanard location such as /usr.  Or perhaps you
already have a version of wxWindows installed on your system (such
as from an RPM) and you want wxPython to use that version too.  If
so then you'll want to ensure that the flags and options used to
build the installed version are compatible with wxPython.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If you do decide to build and install your own wxWindows then there
are a few tweaks to the configure flags described in BUILD.txt that
you will probably want to make.  Instead of --enable-debug use
this configure flag:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
--enable-optimize \
</pre>
<p>Normally I also use the following flag in order to have wxWindows
runtime assertions turned into Python exceptions where possible.
It does add extra code to the build but probably not enough to
worry about it.  However if you want to get as lean a build as
possible you can leave it out, but if your code does something bad
then instead of exceptions you'll likely get a crash.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>--enable-debug_flag </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are building a private copy of wxWindows (IOW, not installed
in a standard library location) then it can be kind of a hassle to
always have to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable so wxPython can
find the wxWindows shared libraries.  You can hard code the library
path into the binaries by using the rpath option when configuring
wxWindows.  For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
--enable-rpath=/opt/wx/2.5/lib \
</pre>
<p>SOLARIS NOTE: The --enable-rpath option may cause problems when
using wxGTK on Solaris when compiling wxPython as described below.
The woraround is to not use --enable-rpath flag for configure, but
in that case all wxPython applications <em>must</em> have the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH set to include $WXPREF/lib, or you can use the
'crle' program to modify the runtime linking environment.  If this
is the only installation of wxGTK on the system then you can use a
system library path for prefix and not have to worry about it at
all.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Build and install wxGTK as described in BUILD.txt.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">In addition to building wxPython as described in BUILD.txt, you can
install it to Python's site-packages dir, as well as some scripts
into the same bin dir used by Python by using this command:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python2.3 setup.py install
</pre>
<p>If you would like to install to some place besides the prefix where
Python is installed, (such as to your home directory) then you can
add &quot;--root=&lt;path&gt;&quot; after the &quot;install&quot; command.  This will use
&lt;path&gt; as the prefix and will install scripts to a bin subdir and
the wxPython packages to a lib subdir.  To use wxPython like this
you'll need to ensure that the directory containing wxPython is
contained in the PYTHONPATH environment variable.</p>
</li>

<div class="section" id="installing-on-os-x">
<h1><a name="installing-on-os-x">Installing on OS X</a></h1>
<p>Installing wxPython on OS X is nearly the same as the Unix
instructions above, except for a few small, but important details:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The --enable-rpath configure option is not needed since the path to
the wxWindows dylibs will automatically be encoded into the
extension modules when they are built.  If you end up moving the
wxWindows dynlibs to some other location (such as inside the .app
bundle of your applicaiton for distribution to other users,) then
you will need to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to this location so the
dylibs can be found at runtime.</li>
<li>Depending on the version of OS X Python may be installed in
different locations.  On 10.2 (Jaguar) you need to download and
install MacPython-OSX-2.3 from <a class="reference" href="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org/</a> and the
Python Framework will then be installed in /Library/Frameworks.  On
10.3 (Panther) Apple supplies the Python Framework as part of the
OS install, but it will be located in /System/Library/Frameworks
instead.  However, on Panther the site-pacakges dir is sym-linked
to /Library/Python/2.3 so the wxPython pacakges will end up there,
although they will still be visible from site-packages.  If you are
building distributions of wxPython to be installed on other
machines be careful to install to /Library/Python/2.3.  To
complicate things further, the Jaguar version, or a custom build
you do yourself will end up in /Library/Frameworks even on
Panther...</li>
<li>You need to use pythonw at the command line or PythonLauncher app
to run wxPython apps, otherwise the app will not be able to fully
use the GUI display.</li>

<div class="section" id="installing-on-windows">
<h1><a name="installing-on-windows">Installing on Windows</a></h1>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Build wxWindows and wxPython as described in BUILD.txt.  If you
would rather have a version without the code that turns runtime
assertions into Python exceptions, then use &quot;release&quot; instead of
&quot;hybrid&quot; when building wxWindows and add &quot;FINAL=1&quot; to the setup.py
command line.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Install wxPython like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python setup.py install
</pre>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Copy the wxWindows DLLs to the wx package directory so they can be
found at runtime by the extension modules without requiring that
they be installed on the PATH:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
copy %WXWIN%\BIN\wx*h_*.dll c:\Python23\Lib\site-pacakges\wx
