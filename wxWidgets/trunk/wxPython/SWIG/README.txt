SWIG 1.3 Patches
================

This directory holds a set of patches for the CVS version of SWIG that
are required if you wish to use SWIG for wxPython development, or for
building your own extension modules that need to interface with
wxPython.  These have been submitted to SWIG's SourceForge patch
tracker, so hopefully they will get incorporated into the main SWIG
source tree soon.

swig.xml.patch		    Adds an option that drastically reduces

swig.python.patch	    Lots of changes for SWIG's Python module,
