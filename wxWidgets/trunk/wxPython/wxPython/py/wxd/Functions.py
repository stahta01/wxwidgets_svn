    C++ objects.

    This is useful in situations where some method returns a generic

    derived type such as a TextCtrl.  You can't call TextCtrl
    specific methods on a Window object, but you can use this

    pointer to the C++ code.  You use it like this:

       textCtrl = PyTypeCast(window, "TextCtrl")
