/**
    @class wxLog
    @wxheader{log.h}

    wxLog class defines the interface for the @e log targets used by wxWidgets
    logging functions as explained in the @ref overview_log.
    The only situations when you need to directly use this class is when you want
    to derive your own log target because the existing ones don't satisfy your
    needs. Another case is if you wish to customize the behaviour of the standard
    logging classes (all of which respect the wxLog settings): for example, set
    which trace messages are logged and which are not or change (or even remove
    completely) the timestamp on the messages.

    Otherwise, it is completely hidden behind the @e wxLogXXX() functions and
    you may not even know about its existence.

     @section overview_wxLog_deriving Deriving your own log target
     
        There are two functions which must be implemented by any derived class to
        actually process the log messages: DoLog() and
        DoLogString(). The second function receives a string
        which just has to be output in some way and the easiest way to write a new log
        target is to override just this function in the derived class. If more control
        over the output format is needed, then the first function must be overridden
        which allows to construct custom messages depending on the log level or even
        do completely different things depending on the message severity (for example,
        throw away all messages except warnings and errors, show warnings on the
        screen and forward the error messages to the user's (or programmer's) cell
        phone - maybe depending on whether the timestamp tells us if it is day or
        night in the current time zone).
        There also functions to support message buffering. Why are they needed?
        Some of wxLog implementations, most notably the standard wxLogGui class,
        buffer the messages (for example, to avoid showing the user a zillion of modal
        message boxes one after another -- which would be really annoying).
        Flush() shows them all and clears the buffer contents.
        This function doesn't do anything if the buffer is already empty.
        See also:
        @li Flush()
        @li FlushActive()

     @section overview_wxLog_Trace_Masks Using trace masks

        The functions below allow some limited customization of wxLog behaviour
        without writing a new log target class (which, aside from being a matter of
        several minutes, allows you to do anything you want).
        The verbose messages are the trace messages which are not disabled in the
        release mode and are generated by wxLogVerbose(). They
        are not normally shown to the user because they present little interest, but
        may be activated, for example, in order to help the user find some program
        problem.
        As for the (real) trace messages, their handling depends on the settings of
        the (application global) @e trace mask which can either be specified using
        SetTraceMask(), GetTraceMask() and wxLogTrace() which takes an integer mask
        or using AddTraceMask() for string trace masks.
        The difference between bit-wise and string trace masks is that a message using
        integer trace mask will only be logged if all bits of the mask are set in the
        current mask while a message using string mask will be logged simply if the
        mask had been added before to the list of allowed ones.
        For example,
        
        @code
        wxLogTrace( wxTraceRefCount|wxTraceOleCalls, "Active object ref count: %d", nRef );
        @endcode

        will do something only if the current trace mask contains both
        @c wxTraceRefCount and @c wxTraceOle, but

        @code
        wxLogTrace( wxTRACE_OleCalls, "IFoo::Bar() called" );
        @endcode
        
        will log the message if it was preceded by
        
        @code
        wxLog::AddTraceMask( wxTRACE_OleCalls);
        @endcode

        Using string masks is simpler and allows you to easily add custom ones, so this is
        the preferred way of working with trace messages. The integer trace mask is
        kept for compatibility and for additional (but very rarely needed) flexibility
        only.
        The standard trace masks are given in wxLogTrace() documentation.
        Finally, the @e wxLog::DoLog() function automatically prepends a time stamp
        to all the messages. The format of the time stamp may be changed: it can be
        any string with % specifications fully described in the documentation of the
        standard @e strftime() function. For example, the default format is
        "[%d/%b/%y %H:%M:%S] " which gives something like "[17/Sep/98 22:10:16] "
        (without quotes) for the current date. Setting an empty string as the time
        format disables timestamping of the messages completely.

        @note Timestamping is disabled for Visual C++ users in debug builds by
        default because otherwise it would be impossible to directly go to the line
        from which the log message was generated by simply clicking in the debugger
        window on the corresponding error message. If you wish to enable it, please
        use SetTimestamp() explicitly. 
        
     @section overview_wxLog_Target Manipulating the log target

        The functions in this section work with and manipulate the active log
        target. The OnLog() is called by the @e wxLogXXX() functions
        and invokes the DoLog() of the active log target if any.
        Get/Set methods are used to install/query the current active target and,
        finally, DontCreateOnDemand() disables the automatic creation of a standard
        log target if none actually exists. It is only useful when the application
        is terminating and shouldn't be used in other situations because it may
        easily lead to a loss of messages. See also
        @li OnLog()

/**
    @class wxLogNull
    @wxheader{log.h}

    This class allows you to temporarily suspend logging. All calls to the log
    functions during the life time of an object of this class are just ignored.

    In particular, it can be used to suppress the log messages given by wxWidgets
    itself but it should be noted that it is rarely the best way to cope with this
    problem as @b all log messages are suppressed, even if they indicate a
    completely different error than the one the programmer wanted to suppress.

    For instance, the example of the overview:

    @code
    wxFile file;

      // wxFile.Open() normally complains if file can't be opened, we don't want it
      {
        wxLogNull logNo;
        if ( !file.Open("bar") )
          ... process error ourselves ...
      } // ~wxLogNull called, old log sink restored

      wxLogMessage("..."); // ok
    @endcode

    would be better written as:

    @code
    wxFile file;

      // don't try to open file if it doesn't exist, we are prepared to deal with
      // this ourselves - but all other errors are not expected
      if ( wxFile::Exists("bar") )
      {
          // gives an error message if the file couldn't be opened
          file.Open("bar");
      }
      else
      {
          ...
      }
    @endcode

    function is that usually there are a lot of trace messages, so it might
    make sense to separate them from other debug messages.

    In this version of wxLogTrace(), trace messages can be separated into
    different categories and calls using this function only log the message if
    the given @a mask is currently enabled in wxLog. This lets you selectively
    trace only some operations and not others by enabling the desired trace
    masks with wxLog::AddTraceMask() or by setting the
    @ref overview_envvars "@c WXTRACE environment variable".

    The predefined string trace masks used by wxWidgets are:

    @beginDefList
    @itemdef{ wxTRACE_MemAlloc, Trace memory allocation (new/delete) }
    @itemdef{ wxTRACE_Messages, Trace window messages/X callbacks }
    @itemdef{ wxTRACE_ResAlloc, Trace GDI resource allocation }
    @itemdef{ wxTRACE_RefCount, Trace various ref counting operations }
    @itemdef{ wxTRACE_OleCalls, Trace OLE method calls (Win32 only) }
    @endDefList

    @note Since both the mask and the format string are strings, this might
          lead to function signature confusion in some cases: if you intend to
          call the format string only version of wxLogTrace(), add a "%s"
          format string parameter and then supply a second string parameter for
          that "%s", the string mask version of wxLogTrace() will erroneously
          get called instead, since you are supplying two string parameters to
          the function. In this case you'll unfortunately have to avoid having
          two leading string parameters, e.g. by adding a bogus integer (with
          its "%d" format string).
