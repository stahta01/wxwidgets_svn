    @class wxLocale
    @wxheader{intl.h}

    wxLocale class encapsulates all language-dependent settings and is a
    generalization of the C locale concept.

    In wxWidgets this class manages message catalogs which contain the translations
    of the strings used to the current language.

    @b wxPerl note: In wxPerl you can't use the '_' function name, so
    the @c Wx::Locale module can export the @c gettext and
    @c gettext_noop under any given name.

    @code
    # this imports gettext ( equivalent to Wx::GetTranslation
      # and gettext_noop ( a noop )
      # into your module
      use Wx::Locale qw(:default);

      # ....

      # use the functions
      print gettext( ``Panic!'' );

      button = Wx::Button-new( window, -1, gettext( ``Label'' ) );
    @endcode

    If you need to translate a lot of strings, then adding gettext( ) around
    each one is a long task ( that is why _( ) was introduced ), so just choose
    a shorter name for gettext:

    @code
    #
      use Wx::Locale 'gettext' = 't',
                     'gettext_noop' = 'gettext_noop';

      # ...

      # use the functions
      print t( ``Panic!!'' );

      # ...
    @endcode

        The second form of this method takes two additional arguments,
        @a msgIdLanguage and @e msgIdCharset.
        @a msgIdLanguage specifies the language of "msgid" strings in source code
        (i.e. arguments to GetString(),
        wxGetTranslation() and the
        _() macro). It is used if AddCatalog cannot find any
        catalog for current language: if the language is same as source code language,
        then strings from source code are used instead.
        @a msgIdCharset lets you specify the charset used for msgids in sources
        in case they use 8-bit characters (e.g. German or French strings).  This
        argument has no effect in Unicode build, because literals in sources are
        Unicode strings; you have to use compiler-specific method of setting the right
        charset when compiling with Unicode.
        By default (i.e. when you use the first form), msgid strings are assumed
        to be in English and written only using 7-bit ASCII characters.
        If you have to deal with non-English strings or 8-bit characters in the source

    Introduction

    This class represents a locale object used by so-called xlocale API. Unlike
    wxLocale it doesn't provide any non-trivial operations but
    simply provides a portable wrapper for POSIX @c locale_t type. It exists
    solely to be provided as an argument to various @c wxFoo_l() functions
    which are the extensions of the standard locale-dependent functions (hence the
    name xlocale). These functions do exactly the same thing as the corresponding
    standard @c foo() except that instead of using the global program locale
    they use the provided wxXLocale object. For example, if the user runs the
    program in French locale, the standard @c printf() function will output
    floating point numbers using decimal comma instead of decimal period. If the
    program needs to format a floating-point number in a standard format it can
    use @c wxPrintf_l(wxXLocale::GetCLocale(), "%g", number) to do it.
    Conversely, if a program wanted to output the number in French locale, even if
    the current locale is different, it could use wxXLocale(wxLANGUAGE_FRENCH).


    Availability

    This class is fully implemented only under the platforms where xlocale POSIX
    API or equivalent is available. Currently the xlocale API is available under
    most of the recent Unix systems (including Linux, various BSD and Mac OS X) and
    Microsoft Visual C++ standard library provides a similar API starting from
    version 8 (Visual Studio 2005).

    If neither POSIX API nor Microsoft proprietary equivalent are available, this
    class is still available but works in degraded mode: the only supported locale
    is the C one and attempts to create wxXLocale object for any other locale will
    fail. You can use the preprocessor macro @c wxHAS_XLOCALE_SUPPORT to
    test if full xlocale API is available or only skeleton C locale support is
    present.

    Notice that wxXLocale is new in wxWidgets 2.9.0 and is not compiled in if
    @c wxUSE_XLOCALE was set to 0 during the library compilation.


    Locale-dependent functions

    Currently the following @c _l-functions are available:

         Character classification functions: @c wxIsxxx_l(), e.g.
              @c wxIsalpha_l(), @c wxIslower_l() and all the others.
         Character transformation functions: @c wxTolower_l() and
              @c wxToupper_l()

    We hope to provide many more functions (covering numbers, time and formatted
    IO) in the near future.

/**
    This macro doesn't do anything in the program code -- it simply expands to
    the value of its argument.

    However it does have a purpose which is to mark the literal strings for the
    extraction into the message catalog created by @c xgettext program. Usually
    this is achieved using _() but that macro not only marks the string for
    extraction but also expands into a wxGetTranslation() call which means that
    it cannot be used in some situations, notably for static array
    initialization.

    Here is an example which should make it more clear: suppose that you have a
    static array of strings containing the weekday names and which have to be
    translated (note that it is a bad example, really, as wxDateTime already
    can be used to get the localized week day names already). If you write:

    @code
    static const char * const weekdays[] = { _("Mon"), ..., _("Sun") };
    ...
    // use weekdays[n] as usual
    @endcode

    The code wouldn't compile because the function calls are forbidden in the
    array initializer. So instead you should do this:

    @code
    static const char * const weekdays[] = { wxTRANSLATE("Mon"), ...,
    wxTRANSLATE("Sun") };
    ...
    // use wxGetTranslation(weekdays[n])
    @endcode

    Note that although the code @b would compile if you simply omit
    wxTRANSLATE() in the above, it wouldn't work as expected because there
    would be no translations for the weekday names in the program message
    catalog and wxGetTranslation() wouldn't find them.

/**
    This function returns the translation of @a string in the current
    @c locale(). If the string is not found in any of the loaded message
    catalogs (see @ref overview_i18n), the original string is returned. In
    debug build, an error message is logged -- this should help to find the
    strings which were not yet translated.  If @a domain is specified then only
    that domain/catalog is searched for a matching string.  As this function is
    used very often, an alternative (and also common in Unix world) syntax is
    provided: the _() macro is defined to do the same thing as
    wxGetTranslation().

    This function calls wxLocale::GetString().

    @note This function is not suitable for literal strings in Unicode builds
          since the literal strings must be enclosed into _T() or wxT() macro
          which makes them unrecognised by @c xgettext, and so they are not
          extracted to the message catalog. Instead, use the _() and wxPLURAL()
          macro for all literal strings.

/**
    This is an overloaded version of
    wxGetTranslation(const wxString&, const wxString&), please see its
    documentation for general information.

    This version is used when retrieving translation of string that has
    different singular and plural forms in English or different plural forms in
    some other language. Like wxGetTranslation(const wxString&,const wxString&),
    the @a string parameter must contain the singular form of the string to be
    converted and is used as the key for the search in the catalog. The
    @a plural parameter is the plural form (in English). The parameter @a n is
    used to determine the plural form. If no message catalog is found,
    @a string is returned if "n == 1", otherwise @a plural is returned.

    See GNU gettext Manual for additional information on plural forms handling:
    <http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Plural-forms>
    For a shorter alternative see the wxPLURAL() macro.

    This function calls wxLocale::GetString().
