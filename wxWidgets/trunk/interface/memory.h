    @class wxDebugStreamBuf
    @wxheader{memory.h}

    This class allows you to treat debugging output in a similar
    (stream-based) fashion on different platforms. Under
    Windows, an ostream constructed with this buffer outputs
    to the debugger, or other program that intercepts debugging
    output. On other platforms, the output goes to standard error (cerr).

    This is soon to be obsolete, replaced by wxLog functionality.
