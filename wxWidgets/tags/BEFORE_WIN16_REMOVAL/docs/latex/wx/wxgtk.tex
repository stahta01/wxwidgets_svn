\section{wxGTK port}\label{wxgtkport}

wxGTK is a port of wxWindows using the GTK+ library available
from www.gtk.org. It makes use of GTK+'s native widgets wherever
possible and uses wxWindows' generic controls when needed. GTK+
itself has been ported to a number of systems, but so far only the
original X11 version is supported. Support for the recently released
GTK+ 2.0 including Unicode support is work in progress.

You will need GTK+ 1.2.3 or higher which is available from:

\urlref{http://www.gtk.org}{http://www.gtk.org}

In order to configure wxWindows to compile wxGTK you will 
need to type:

\begin{verbatim}
  configure --with-gtk
\end{verbatim}

For further information, please see the files in docs/gtk
in the distribution.
