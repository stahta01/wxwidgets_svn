What's in here:

lseditorplugin
	-- minimal wrap of Alexanders Gluchovas' editor plugin. The code was
	ransacked from the wxStudio (http://wxstudio.linuxbox.com) project.
	Since the editor is released under the Gnu Public License, this
	module, as a derivative work, is also released under this licence
	and NOT THE WXWINDOWS LICENSE. See the file COPYING for details.
	the file 'editor.py' contains a sample implementation using the
	editorplugin object.
