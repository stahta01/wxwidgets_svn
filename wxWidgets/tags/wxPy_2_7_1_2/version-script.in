#   # public symbols added in release 2.6.2 (please keep in alphabetical order):
#   
#   @WX_VERSION_TAG@.2 {
#       global:
#           *wxChoice*GetCurrentSelection*;
#   };


# symbols available since the beginning of this branch are only given
# generic branch tag (don't remove this!):

    global:
        *;
};
