- Suggestion from Janos Vegh: the memory-checking classes could
  also keep return the size of memory currently allocated, with
  a call to return it e.g. int wxDebugContext::GetMemoryUsed().
  Maybe even an optional window in debug mode with a tally of memory
  usage, how many classes of each kind are in use, etc.? That
  would be neat.

- In doc/view file selector, document type is selected by
  extension, not the type selected in the (Windows) file selector.

- wxArrayDouble class?
