/*
 * class implements optimized logic for refreshing
 * areas of frame layout - which actually need to be updated. 
 * Is used as default updates-manager by wxFrameLayout.
 *
 * it is called "Garbage Collecting" u.mgr for it's implementation
 * tries to find out dependencies between bars, and to order
 * them ito "hierarchy", this hierarchical sorting resembles
 * implemenation of heap-garbage collectors, which resolve
 * dependencies between references.
 *
 * Example: there are situations where the order of moving
 *          the windows does matter:
 *
 *   case 1)                
 *      ------		    ---
 *      | A	 |	 	    |B|  
 *		------	 --->  	| |
 *			---		   	--- ------ 
 *			|B|		   		| A  | 
 *			| |		   		------
 *			---		   		
 *						(future)
 *	   (past)            
 *
 *  past/future positions of A and B windows completely overlapp, i.e.
 *  depend on each other, and there is not solution for
 *  moving the windows witout refreshing both of them,
 *  -- we have cyclic dependency here. The gc. alg will
 *  find this cyclic dependecy and will force "refresh"
 *  after movement.
 *
 *   case 2)
 *
 *      ------		                        
 *      | A	 |	 	                        
 * 		------	 --->                       
 * 			---		                  
 * 			|B|		   		           ------   
 * 			| |		   		           | A  |   
 * 			---		   		           ------         
 *						 ---
 *						 |B|
 *						 | |
 *					     ---
 *
 * 						(future)                
 * 	   (past)       
 *
 *  in this case past/future positions do not overlapp, thus
 *  it's enough only to move windows, without refreshing them.
 *  GC will "notice" it.
 *
 *  there is also third case, when overlapping is partial
 *  in this case the refershing can be also avoided by
 *  moving windows in the order of "most-dependant" towards the
 *  "least-dependent". GC handles this automatically, by
 *  sorting windows by their dependency-level (or "hierarchy")
 *
 *  See garbagec.h for more details of this method, garbagec.h/cpp
 *  implement sorting of generic-dependencies (does not deal
 *  with graphical objects directly)
 *
 *  Summary: improves performance when complex/large windows are 
 *           moved around, by reducing number of repaints. Also helps 
 *           to avoid dirty non-client areas of moved windows
 *           in some special cases of "overlapping anomalies"
