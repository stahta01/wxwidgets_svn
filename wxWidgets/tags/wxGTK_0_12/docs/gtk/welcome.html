<h3>Current version</h3>
15th May '98: wxGTK v0.12 (alpha-)
<p> 
This release is hardly more stable than the one before, but it
has many new features. It's main purpose is actually to prepare
the final merge of the Windows port and the GTK port source
trees into a common tree, developed using CVS. The growing
number of demos which compile and run with wxGTK "although"
being written for wxMSW shows that we seem to be on the right
track. One nice new feature for many potential users is that
wxGTK no longer needs any extra libraries to be installed,
other than the GTK.
<p>
If you have a compiler
better than gcc 2.7.2.2 then you can uncomment a line in src/common/prntbase.cpp
which defines __GOOD_COMPILER__. This should make the printing demo work.
I haven't got such a compiler, so I actually don't know. Somebody reported
problems with version 2.7.2.3 as well.

<h3>What is wxWindows?</h3>
wxWindows is a C++ cross-platform GUI toolkit written mainly by Julian Smart. 
More information about wxWindows can be found at the
<a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/julian.smart/wxwin">wxWindows Homepage</a>.

<p>
The current version of wxWindows (v1.68) supports Windows ('95 and NT), Motif and
XView (aka OpenLook). There is another port (wxXt) available, which uses the 
free-ware widget set from the Free Widget Foundation (FSF). Ports have been
started for the Mac, OS/2 and NextStep.
<p>
For different reasons, it was decided to start a complete rewrite of wxWindows,
which will then be called wxWindows 2.0. For a list of new features and changes
from the current version, you may read the wxWindows Homepage (see above).
<p>
Currently, work is being done on four ports of wxWindows 2.0:
<dl>
  <li> Windows (wxMSW, main author Julian Smart)
  <li> Unix, Motif (wxMotif, main author Markus Holzhem)
  <li> Unix, GIMP Toolkit (wxGTK, main author Robert Roebling)
  <li> Macintosh (wxMac, main author Greg Whitehead)
</dl>
<p>
wxWindows provides a rich set of classes which help to make cross-platform
GUI programming easy. In many aspect, it is modelled after MFC, making transition
from MFC to wxWindows relatively painless. The main technical
difference between most other free or commercial cross platform libraries is
that wxWindows is a wrapper around existing widget sets, whereas the other
toolkits (Qt, Tk, Java, Amulet, OPaC, JX, Fresko) draw their widgets themselves, 
which results in applications having a different look than native applications 
for that specific platform.
<p>
There are classes for the following categories
<dl>
  <li> Window classes: wxWindow, wxFrame, wxDialogBox, wxPanel, wxCanvas etc.
  <li> Widget classes: wxButton, wxCheckbox, wxChoice, wxListBox, wxListCtrl, wxText, wxGauge etc.
  <li> Data structures: wxList, wxString, wxHashTable, wxDate etc.
  <li> Layout/constraint system
  <li> GDI classes: wxPen, wxBrush, wxFont, wxBitmap etc.
  <li> Events: wxCommandEvent, wxMouseEvent, wxKeyEvent etc.
  <li> Devices contexts: wxCanvasDC, wxPostScriptDC, wxMemoryDC, wxPrinterDC
  <li> Base classes for runtime-type information: wxObject
  <li> Interprocess communication: wxClient, wxConnection, wxSocket, wxServer etc.
  <li> Document-view architecture: wxDocument, wxView, wxDocManager etc.
  <li> Printing framework: wxPreviewFrame, wxPrintDialog, wxPrinter etc.
  <li> Many helper classes, wxApplication, wxTypeTree, wxPathList etc.
  <li> Classes for internationalization
  <li> Built-in memory leak checking, log-files
  <li> A multitude of functions and macros

<h3>Copyright</h3>
The choice of a suitable copyright has been subject to endless discussions. It
has always been the aim, to put wxWindows under a copyright, which protects
the work of its authors while at the same time encouraging the use of wxWindows
in as many projects as possible. 
<p>
The (so far) last decision has been to put the whole of wxWindows
under a modified (less restrictive) version of the GNU library general 
public license.
<p>
The only exception is that wxGTK now contains code (gdk_imlib) which is 
under the GNU library general public license. When you make changes to 
this part of wxGTK, you'll have to make these changes public (in contrast 
to changes to the rest).
<p>
It is obviously encouraged that anybody who uses wxWindows and who
makes any improvements to it will make these changes available to
wxWindows' authors.
<p>

<h3>What can I do with wxWindows 2.0?</h3>
wxWindows is still in alpha stage, which means that there are still bugs
waiting for you and several features are not yet (fully) implemented, but
you can expect the interface to be more or less stable, so no major 
modifications will have to be made to your source code. wxGTK is already
used in a number of medium sized projects and is it being developped
in close cooperation with the authors of these applications.
<p>

<h3>Can I write a GNOME application with wxGTK 2.0?</h3>
Good question. The idea to use wxGTK for the GNOME desktop environment is
quite obvious. When this topic came up on the GNOME mailing list, the GNOME
people have shown an amazingly negative opinion about wxWindows. One reason
might be that several of the main authors of the GNOME-project consider
C++ a "broken language". I don't share that view and I am sure many people
find C++ easier to handle and better suited for GUI programming than C.
<p>
Just recently, the topic of C++ in general and wxGTK in particular appeared
again on the GNOME list. It has shown that - at least - the opinion on C++
on the GNOME list is split. 
<p>
There is already a C++ wrapper for the GTK called GTK-- written by Tero Pulkkinen. 
It is very small and adds very little overhead to the GTK. If platform
independence is no issue for you and you want to write a small tool
for Linux, you should probably use GTK--. Of course you can use wxGTK
for that, too :-)
<p>

<h3>Screenshots</h3>
What would a home page of a GUI be without a screenshot? Well, as wxWindows
is a wrapper around existing widget/item sets, a wxWindows application will
look like any other native Windows, Motif, GTK or Mac application.
<p>
But for those of you, who wouldn't download wxGTK only because there
is no screenshot, 
<a href="ftp://ftp.freiburg.linux.de/pub/linux/wxxt/sshot.jpg">here it comes</a>.

<h3>News from wxGTK 0.12</h3>
<p>
PNG, zlib and gdk_imlib code included.
<p>
MDI implementation. More a basis for further testing
than of real value.
<p>
Split "--with-debug" option into two options: "--with-debug_info"
and "--with-debug_flag". The first one sets the "-g" flag when
compiling, the second defines "DEBUG" in setup.h (which is included
from defs.h).
<p>
Merged DocView framework. The sample doesn't compile yet, because
it uses features from wxTextCtrl, which I haven't implemented yet.
<p>
Merged TabCtrl. Doesn't look perfect, but it seems to work.
<p>
Merged remaining classes from the newest wxMSW alpha. (wxDynArray,
wxModule etc.).
<p>
Further updates, bug fixes or additions:
<p>
<dl>
  <li> wxYield() (again)
  <li> postscript support for bitmaps
  <li> spline code merged
  <li> several bug fixes
  <li> new samples
</dl>

<p>

<h3>Installation of wxGTK under Linux</h3>

GTK requires an up-to-date version of the 
<dl>
  <li> GTK (GIMP ToolKit)
</dl>
to be installed as a shared lib on your system. wxGTK is being developped with
version 1.0.1 and it is known not to work with earlier versions.
The GTK library is available from 
<a href="ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/">somewhere here (gtk.org).</a>
After having typed "make install" the GTK header files should be
in "/usr/local/include". Correct me, if I am wrong.
<p>
Compilation itself works as usual with autoconf:
<dl>
  <li> Unpack it to a suitable subdirectory, let's say ~/wxGTK
  <li> Type "cd wxGTK"
  <li> Type "configure"
  <li> Type "make"
</dl>
Some demos use files stored in the source directory of those demos
(e.g. internat uses files in samples/internat) whereas the binaries
will end up in samples/internat/linux. You'll have to copy the binaries
down or call them like "linux/test" from samples/internat. This is
also the case for wxTest (which should display a horse).
<p>
You can create a shared library by adding the option "--with-shared" to
the "configure" command. Afterwards, you'll have to copy the library
~/wxGTK/lib/linux (if you have Linux) to a directory in your LDPATH (e.g. /usr/X11R6/lib)
and run "ldconfig".

<h3>Mailing list for wxGTK</h3>
The mailing list (as well as this page) is called wxxt for more
or less historical reasons.
<p>
You can subsribe to the mailing list by sending a mail to
<a href="mailto:majordomo@wesley.informatik.uni-freiburg.de">majordomo@wesley.informatik.uni-freiburg.de</a>.
This mail must contain the text "subscribe wxxt" in the body (not the subject) of the
mail. You will then get a confirmation that somebody asked majordomo to put you
on the list and you will have to confirm this once again by sending back
the authentisation, which comes in the confirmation mail. The last step
is also described in the actual confirmation mail (I think).
<p>
You can send a mail to the mailing list to the address
<a href="mailto:wxxt@www.freiburg.linux.de">wxxt@www.freiburg.linux.de</a>.

<p>
Unsubscribe by sending "unsubscribe wxxt" to majordomo (see above). Not to
the actual mailing list.
