wxWindows Release Notes
-----------------------

2.1.11
======

- wxMenu no longer takes a wxFunction argument: either use
  event handlers in the menu's host window or set WXWIN_COMPATIBILITY
  to 1 in setup.h, and recompile.

- wxMotif still lags behind other ports but is in much better
  shape than the 2.0.1 distribution.

- Clipboard/drag and drop is still not implemented in wxMotif.

- The new wxGrid implementation is in beta, but the original
  implementation can be restored by setting wxUSE_NEW_GRID
  to 0 (in wxMSW) or passing --disable-newgrid to configure
  (wxGTK/wxMSW). Pass --enable-newgrid to configure to enable
  the new implementation.

- wxHTML is partially working in wxMotif. The About sample
  works, but the others exhibit refresh problems. So light
  use of wxHTML is recommended on wxMotif.

- The wxHTML helpview application crashes on exit if
  using VC++ 6 in release mode and loading a large amount of
  HTML (such as the wxWindows manual generated using Tex2RTF).
  This may be a compiler problem and will be investigated
  for 2.1.12.

- wxHTML printing has spacing problems under Windows, and may not
  work fully under Unix. Hopefully this will be resolved for 2.1.12.

- wxStaticBox under Windows obscures controls placed within it:
  this will be fixed in 2.1.12.

- wxStaticBitmap under Windows doesn't respect the transparency mask.
