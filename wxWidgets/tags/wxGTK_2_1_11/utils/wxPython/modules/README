Modules subdir, more info later...

stubs contains a template for new modules.

html, lseditor are more or less usuable.

glcanvas is moved from the main src directory.

Note, there are no SWIG generated files in CVS yet. I don't expect them to
be useful at this stage, since you can't hack this stuff without a working &
patched up SWIG anyway. Besides, those big files really bog down my phone
line.
