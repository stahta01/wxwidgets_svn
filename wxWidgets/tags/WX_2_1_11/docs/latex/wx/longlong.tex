\section{\class{wxLongLong}}\label{wxlonglong}

This class represents a signed 64 bit long number. It is implemented using the
native 64 bit type where available (machines with 64 bit longs or compilers
which have (an analog of) {\it long long} type) and uses the emulation code in
the other cases which ensures that it is the most efficient solution for
working with 64 bit integers independently of the architecture.

wxLongLong defines all usual arithmetic operations such as addition,
substraction, bitwise shifts and logical operations as well as multiplication
and division (not yet for the machines without native {\it long long}). It
also has operators for implicit construction from and conversion to the native 
{\it long long} type if it exists and {\it long}.

You would usually use this type in exactly the same manner as any other
(built-in) arithmetic type.
