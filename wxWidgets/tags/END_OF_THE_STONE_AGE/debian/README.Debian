wxwidgets for Debian
----------------------

The following packages are built from the wxWidgets CVS source.

libwxgtk		wxGTK runtime shared libraries
libwxgtk-dev		extra files and static libs for building wxGTK apps
libwxgtk-dbg		wxGTK libraries built with -g and __WXDEBUG__

libwxgtk-python		Python binding to wxGTK  (from 2.2.3 onward, this
			obsoletes the libwxgtk-python-contrib package as
			all python modules are built into a single monolith)

libwxgtk-contrib	wxWin contrib runtime shared libs (built with wxGTK)
libwxgtk-contrib-dev	extra files and static contrib libs for building apps

wx-headers		common header files for building wxWidgets apps
wx-doc			HTML version of the wxWidgets manual
wx-examples		wxWidgets and wxPython demos and samples (source)
wx-i18n			message catalogs for native language support


	The following binaries can be built from the source package
	with the mingw32 cross compiler, but are not currently
	distributed by Debian.  If you feel that should change,
	please file a bug against the wxwidgets2.5 package, or
	append your views to a report already there if you're not
	the first to do so.

	[ you can check the current state of affairs at:
	  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=wxwidgets2.5 ]

	Oh and, please do *not* file bug reports for these packages
	to the Debian bts.  But do feel free to email me personally
	if you find problems and/or have patches to fix them.

libwxmsw-dev		mingw32-cross wxMSW libs.
libwxmsw-dbg		mingw32-cross wxMSW (debug) libs.
wx-headers-msw		extra headers needed for wxMSW.

	You can build these extra packages using the binary-cross target
	in debian/rules.


	It is also possible to build a libwxgtk-dbg-python package.
	There are some limitations (like this package cannot be installed
	concurrently with the release version), but some developers may
	find such a thing useful in any case.  It will transparently
	replace the release package for installed apps that depend on the
	release package, but should NEVER be used when preparing packages
	for upload.  This package may be created from the source using the
	binary-dbg-py target in debian/rules.  (note that doing this will
	also destroy any release build that exists in the same tree, they
	cannot coexist there either yet)


	Finally, because all of these packages can take quite some time to
	build, the source package supports the use of distcc.  The package
	builds will automatically parallelise to suit the number of hosts
	you have listed in DISTCC_HOSTS.  This will work for both native
	and cross builds of the c++ libraries, if you have the relevant
	compilers on all your build hosts.  wxPython builds cannot be
	parallelised at this stage and will run serially regardless of
	your configuration.
