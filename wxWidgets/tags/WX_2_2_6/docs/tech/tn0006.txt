How to make RPMs of the wxWindows sources
=========================================

This is just a short description. It is assumed that you know what you are
doing. I do not take any responsibility for damaged systems, use at your own
risk!

	1. Extract the archive in a temporary directory. Since you are
	   reading this text, you already have done this.
	2. Copy the .spec file to
		(rpm-dir)/SPECS
	3. Copy the .tgz file to
		(rpm-dir)/SOURCES
	4. Start the RPM manager with
		rpm -bb (rpm-dir)/SPECS/(.spec-file)
	   or with
		rpm -ba (rpm-dir)/SPECS/(.spec-file)
	   (the latter also builds the .src.rpm-file)
	5. You now have a nice set of RPMs in (rpm-dir)/RPMS

Example
=======

Here's how to install e.g. wxMotif 2.1.14:

	cp wxMotif.spec /usr/src/packages/SPECS
	cp wxMotif-2.1.14.tgz /usr/src/packages/SOURCES
	rpm -bb /usr/src/packages/SPECS/wxMotif.spec

Install the resulting packages with

	rpm --install /usr/src/packages/RPMS/i386/wxMotif-2.1.14-0.i386.rpm
	rpm --install /usr/src/packages/RPMS/i386/wxMotif-devel-2.1.14-0.i386.rpm
	rpm --install /usr/src/packages/RPMS/i386/wxMotif-gl-2.1.14-0.i386.rpm



That's all. You should now have a working wxWindows library.
