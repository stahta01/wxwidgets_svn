This is a development snapshot, sometimes known as
an 'unstable' release. Improvements over 2.4.x include:
numerous bug fixes, STL-like container classes,
improved GTK+ 2 compatibility, new build system,
improved Unicode compatibility, wxRenderer class,
shaped frame and dialog windows on Windows and GTK+,
more efficient UI update processing, print preview
improvements, wxCrashReport class, OpenWatcom and

over 2.5.2 include much improved Mac OS X and Windows CE
support, as well as the usual bug fixes and minor enhancements.

*** About wxWidgets

wxWidgets is a comprehensive open-source, multi-platform C++ GUI
framework, that can be used to build commercial and free
software. First released in 1992 under the name wxWindows, it's
increasingly used by organisations and individuals all over the
world due to its winning combination of sophistication, wide
platform coverage, ease of use, unrestrictive licence and
vibrant user community.

For most ports, wxWidgets adopts the native look and feel of
each platform since it uses the native widget sets. There is also
a generic widget set, used for example by the wxX11 port - no
other widget set is required, giving the potential for embedded
use.

An extraordinary range of classes is provided - but don't be put
off by this because most people find wxWidgets easier to learn
and use than MFC and other frameworks.

As well as comprehensive support for the usual widgets, advanced
features include: HTML viewing/printing, wxImage class providing
handlers for reading and writing many image types, resizeable panels
and dialogs on all platforms, document/view, OpenGL support,
HTML-based and context-sensitive help, wizards, drag and drop,
a grid class, ODBC support, threads, sockets, container classes,
a styled text control, and much more. An 1800-page reference manual
is provided in HTML, MS HTML Help, WinHelp, wxWidgets Help and PDF
formats, and there are over 80 samples and demos.

If you're an MFC user, you'll find many wxWidgets concepts
reassuringly familiar, while often clearer and more consistent.
If you're not, you should still find it intuitive from the start.

wxWidgets bindings for several other languages are available,
including Python, Perl, Basic, Lua, JavaScript and Eiffel.
