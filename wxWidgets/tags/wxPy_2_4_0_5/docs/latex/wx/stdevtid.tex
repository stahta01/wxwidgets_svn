\section{Standard event identifiers}\label{stdevtid}

wxWindows defines a special identifier value {\tt wxID\_ANY} which is used in
the following two situations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item when creating a new window you may specify {\tt wxID\_ANY} to let
          wxWindows assign an unused identifier to it automatically
    \item when installing an event handler using either the event table
          macros or \helpref{wxEvtHandler::Connect}{wxevthandlerconnect}
          you may use it to indicate that you want to handle the events
          coming from any control, regardless of its identifier
\end{itemize}

wxWindows also defines a few standard command identifiers which may be used by
the user code and also are sometimes used by wxWindows itself. These reserved
identifiers are all in the range between {\tt wxID\_LOWEST} and 
{\tt wxID\_HIGHEST} and, accordingly, the user code should avoid defining its
own constants in this range.
