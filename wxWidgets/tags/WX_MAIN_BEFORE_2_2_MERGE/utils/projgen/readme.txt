About ProjGen

ProjGen generates VC++ 5 project files (convertible to VC++ 6) for the standard wxWindows
samples. These can be used with wxvc.dsp, wxvc6.dsp, wxvc_dll.
dsp. It can't generate library project files, yet.

I started to write code and a UI to allow the user to generate
his own project files, but this is currently unfinished. It
shouldn't be hard to complete, though.
