# Depending on how your Python was built, you may have to set this
# value to use the C++ driver to link with instead of the default
# C driver.  For example:
#MY_LDSHARED=$(CCC) -shared

# Same as above, but for statically linking Python and wxPython together,
# in other words, if you comment out the *shared* above.  If this is the
# case then you should ensure that the main() function is Python's, not
# wxWindows'.  You can rebuild $(WXWIN)/src/gtk/app.cpp with NOMAIN defined
# to force this...
MY_LINKCC=$(CCC)


## Pick one of these, or set your own.  This is where the
## wxPython module should be installed.  It should be a
## subdirectory named wxPython.
