  Welcome to wxWindows/Gtk,
  
you have downloaded version 1.96 of the GTK+ port of C++ library
wxWindows. Information on how to install can be found in the
file install.txt, but if you cannot wait, this should work on
all systems

configure --without-threads
make
su (PASSWORD)
make install

wxWindows/Gtk is still in development and you can have a look
at the todo.txt to see what's missing before an official beta
and - more important - before we can aim at binary compatibility.

More information is available from my homepage at

  http://wesley.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~wxxt
  
Please send problems concerning installation, feature requests, 
bug reports or comments to either the wxGTK mailing list or to
the wxWindows developers list. Information on how to subscribe
is available from my homepage.

wxWindows/Gtk comes with no guarantee whatsoever. It might crash
your harddisk or destroy your monitor. It doesn't claim to be
suitable for any special purpose.

  Regards,

    Robert Roebling
