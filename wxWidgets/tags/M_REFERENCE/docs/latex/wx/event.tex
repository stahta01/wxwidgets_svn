\section{\class{wxEvent}}\label{wxevent}

An event is a structure holding information about an event passed to a
callback or member function. {\bf wxEvent} used to be a multipurpose
event object, and is an abstract base class for other event classes (see below).

\membersection{wxEvent::wxEvent}

\func{}{wxEvent}{\param{int }{id = 0}}

Constructor. Should not need to be used directly by an application.

\membersection{wxEvent::m\_eventHandle}

\member{char*}{m\_eventHandle}

Handle of an underlying windowing system event handle, such as
XEvent. Not guaranteed to be instantiated.

\membersection{wxEvent::m\_eventObject}

\member{wxObject*}{m\_eventObject}

The object (usually a window) that the event was generated from,
or should be sent to.

\membersection{wxEvent::m\_eventType}

\member{WXTYPE}{m\_eventType}

The type of the event, such as wxEVENT\_TYPE\_BUTTON\_COMMAND.

\membersection{wxEvent::m\_id}

\member{int}{m\_id}

Identifier for the window.

\membersection{wxEvent::m\_skipped}

\member{bool}{m\_skipped}

Set to TRUE by {\bf Skip} if this event should be skipped.

\membersection{wxEvent::m\_timeStamp}

\member{long}{m\_timeStamp}

Timestamp for this event.

\membersection{wxEvent::GetEventClass}

\func{WXTYPE}{GetEventClass}{\void}

Returns the identifier of the given event class,
such as wxTYPE\_MOUSE\_EVENT.

\membersection{wxEvent::GetEventObject}

\func{wxObject*}{GetEventObject}{\void}

Returns the object associated with the
event, if any.

\membersection{wxEvent::GetEventType}

\func{WXTYPE}{GetEventType}{\void}

Returns the identifier of the given event type,
such as wxEVENT\_TYPE\_BUTTON\_COMMAND.

\membersection{wxEvent::GetId}

\func{int}{GetId}{\void}

Returns the identifier associated with this event, such as a button command id.

\membersection{wxEvent::GetObjectType}

\func{WXTYPE}{GetObjectType}{\void}

Returns the type of the object associated with the
event, such as wxTYPE\_BUTTON.

\membersection{wxEvent::GetSkipped}

\func{bool}{GetSkipped}{\void}

Returns TRUE if the event handler should be skipped, FALSE otherwise.

\membersection{wxEvent::GetTimestamp}

\func{long}{GetTimestamp}{\void}

Gets the timestamp for the event.

\membersection{wxEvent::SetEventObject}

\func{void}{SetEventObject}{\param{wxObject* }{object}}

Sets the originating object.

\membersection{wxEvent::SetEventType}

\func{void}{SetEventType}{\param{WXTYPE }{typ}}

Sets the event type.

\membersection{wxEvent::SetId}

\func{void}{SetId}{\param{int}{ id}}

Sets the identifier associated with this event, such as a button command id.

\membersection{wxEvent::SetTimestamp}

\func{void}{SetTimestamp}{\param{long }{timeStamp}}

Sets the timestamp for the event.

Sets the originating object.

\membersection{wxEvent::Skip}\label{wxeventskip}

\func{void}{Skip}{\param{bool}{ skip = TRUE}}

Called by an event handler to tell the event system that the
event handler should be skipped, and the next valid handler used
instead.
