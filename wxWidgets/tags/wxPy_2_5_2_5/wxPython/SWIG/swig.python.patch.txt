This patch makes a number of changes to the SWIG python module.

1. Add -apply option, and change the default code output to use the
   foo(*args, **kw) calling syntax instead of using apply().  If the
   -apply option is given then code is generated as before.  This is
   very similar to Patch #737281 but the new -modern option makes the
   second half of that patch unnecessary so it is not included here.

2. Add -new_repr option.  This is the same as my Patch #797002 which I
   will mark as closed since it is no longer needed.  When this new
   option is used then the __repr__ methods that are generated for
   proxy classes will be more informative and give details about the
   python class and the C++ class.

3. Add %feature("addtofunc").  It allows you to insert one or more
   lines of code inside the shadow method or function that is already
   generated, instead of replacing the whole thing like
   %feature("shadow") does.  For __init__ it goes at the end, for
   __del__ it goes at the begining and for all others the code
   generated is expanded out to be like

    def Bar(*args, **kwargs):
        val = _module.Foo_Bar(*args, **kwargs)
        return val

   and the "addtofunc" code is inserted just before the return
   statement. If the feature is not used for a particular method or
   function then the shorter code is generated just like before.

4. A little bit of refactoring to make implementing addtofunc a little
   easier.

5. Added a -modern command-line flag that will cause SWIG to omit the
   cruft in the proxy modules that allows it to work with versions of
   Python prior to 2.2.  The result is a simpler, cleaner and faster
   python proxy module, but one that requires Python 2.2 or greater.
   For most of us this requirement is easy to live with!


I've been using and greatly benefiting from all these features with
wxPython for the last few weeks and have had no problems.

This patch depends upon Patch #829317.
