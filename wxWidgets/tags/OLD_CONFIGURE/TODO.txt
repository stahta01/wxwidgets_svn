Priority classification:                Amount of work expected:
9       next point release                      q       quick fix
8       next release                            s       small change

1       probably not
-       unclassified

After the subject the name in brackets indicates the person who is going to do
it.

=============================== common ========================================

4w wxString optimization (VZ)
   allocate more memory than needed to avoid reallocation each time when
   operator+ or += is used.

6b stream classes (VZ)

=============================== generic  ======================================

7s wxTreeCtrl root item (RR)
   root item is not shown currently (unlike in MSW version)

5w wxImageList
   it's not implemented currently, to do (assuming that all images have the
   same size - no resizing should be done to simplify the job)

================================ MSW ==========================================

7w consistent keyboard interface and focus behaviour (VZ)
   currently, the focus is lost all the time (after a MessageBox, for example)
   and sometimes TABbing through controls doesn't work

================================ GTK  ==========================================

9m keyboard interface (RR)
   TAB traversal, Alt-letter accelerators for the controls and accelerators
   for menu items - TODO.

3b wxTreeCtrl native implementation?
   GTK has a GtkCTree widget which seems to be quite close to the Windows
   standard control - what about writing a native wxTreeCtrl based on it?
