 - Add wxPropertyView::OnPropertyChange(wxProperty *property) member
   so that when a property is changed, this can be immediately
   reflected in the object. Derive a new wxPropertyListView
   in dialoged.
   
 - Make the property list a modeless dialog or (preferably) resizeable
   frame. Allow many property lists to be up at once. Associate
   real window, resource and property list. When window is deleted,
   delete property list.
