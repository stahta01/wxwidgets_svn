wxWindows Buglist
-----------------

wxGTK:
------

- It is impossible to reposition a window before showing it
  on screen. Suspected GTK bug.
  
- DnD does only moderately work.

wxMSW:
------

- TODO

wxMotif:
--------

- If a popup wxMenu is destroyed after its parent window has been
  destroyed, we get the message "Object XXX does not have windowed
  ancestor".
  Workaround: delete the menu before deleting the window on which it
  was popped up.
  Possible fix: call menu->DestroyMenu() before deleting the window,
  if the window knows about the menu that was last popped up (hard
  to know this with confidence).

- In wxGrid, cell highlight is not drawn/erased properly.

- Setting the size of a hidden window may show that window.

- wxRadioBox sometimes doesn't show (e.g. in controls sample).

- Can't set the colours for the buttons in the file selector, for
  some reason.

- On SGI IRIX 6.4, XtDestroyWidget in ~wxWindow causes a crash in
  some cicumstances. This is being looked into. Meanwhile, a
  possible workaround is to remove the final XtDestroyWidget line in ~wxWindow
  (window.cpp). This will mean that child windows will only get
  destroyed when frames and dialogs are destroyed, so dynamic subwindow
  deletion may not work properly.

- There are reports that scrolling can cause crashes under Lesstif.
  This is probably a Lesstif bug.

General:
--------

- Dialog Editor could be more user-friendly. Controls are hard to
  size and position accurately. No way of changing tab order
  except by editing .wxr file.
