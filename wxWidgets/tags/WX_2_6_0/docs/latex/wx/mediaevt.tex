\twocolitem{{\bf EVT\_MEDIA\_STOP(func)}}{
Triggerred right before the media stops.  You can Veto this event to prevent it from stopping, causing it to continue playing - even if it has reached that end of the media. }
\twocolitem{{\bf EVT\_MEDIA\_FINISHED(func)}}{Sent when a media has finished playing in a \helpref{wxMediaCtrl}{wxmediactrl}.  Note that if you connect to this event and don't skip it, it will override the looping behaviour of the media control.}
