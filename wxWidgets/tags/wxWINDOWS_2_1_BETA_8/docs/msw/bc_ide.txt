1. What you can do with this ide-files
======================================
There are three ide-files. One ide-file should help you to create the wxWindows libraries from within the Ide of Borlands C++, v. 5.x. The second is called bc32d.ide and produces the debug-version of the wxWindows-library.
If you want to produce the debugging-version, using the special ide-file bc32d.ide you have to create a seperate subdirectory \WXWIN_PATH\src\debug.
The last one should help you to create most of the samples of wxWindows.

2. Where to install the files
=============================
You should copy the files for the libraries into the src-directory of your wxWindows-Installation (e.g. C:\wxwin\src).
And the other file for the samples should be copied into the samples-directory (e.g. C:\wxwin\samples).

3. How to modify them for your own needs
========================================
If your wxWindows-Installation resides on the same drive as your Borland-Compiler and additionally the Borland-Installation is the default (e.g. C:\BC5) then there should be no need to change anything.
Otherwise please change the path from within the ide (Options->project->directories). Because we use the $inherit-makro (Julian foung the trick), this should do the trick.

4. How to create ide-files for your own wxWindows-programs
==========================================================
I think you are familiar with the necessary options for your own programm. So I will only describe what is neccessary to link yout programm with the wxWindows-library. If you want to create a ide-file for your own wxWindows-program, create a new project from the menu file->new->project. Deactivate all the standard-options, the only two thing that should be aktivated is "static" for the libraries, if you want to use the library produced with the library-ide and the checkbox OLE (You can leave this checkbox unchecked, but then you have to add the library \bc5\lib\ole2w32.lib to your project). You have to add the include-path of wxWindows to the include-path in the options-dialog (options->project->directories->include). The result should be something like:
path_of_my_program;\bc5\include;\wxwin2\include;
Then you have to add the libraries to the project.
Open the project-view and activate your programm. Then right-click and choose "add" and select the wxWindows-library (e.g. \wxwin\lib\wx32.lib).
