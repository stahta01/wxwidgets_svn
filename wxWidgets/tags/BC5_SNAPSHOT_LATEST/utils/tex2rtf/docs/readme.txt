+++++                      Announcing Tex2RTF                         +++++
+++++  A Free LaTeX to RTF, Windows Help RTF, HTML & wxHelp converter +++++

Purpose
=======

  *  Allows you to maintain manuals in printed and hypertext formats.

  *  Allows conversion of existing LaTeX documents to word processor
     formats (usually some 'tweaking' is required to conform to
     Tex2RTF restrictions).

Input
=====

A LaTeX subset with some additional hypertext macros; no maths,
minimal table support.

Caveat: Please do not expect to convert arbitrary LaTex files without
editing: this is not the primary intention of Tex2RTF. Success converting
existing LaTeX depends on your expectations and the style in which
the LaTeX was written. Tex2RTF does not accept pure TeX (non-LaTeX)
documents.

Output
======

  *  ordinary RTF

  *  Windows Help hypertext RTF

  *  HTML (the World Wide Web hypertext format)

  *  wxHelp (the wxWindows GUI library help file format)

Installation
============

Under Windows, please run the supplied install.exe program. The Tex2RTF
manual itself serves as an example input file, in the docs subdirectory
with various .sty, .ini, and .gif files that you may need for your
own documents. See the online manual for further details.

Platforms supported
===================

  *  SPARC Open Look

  *  SPARC Motif

  *  Windows 3.1
