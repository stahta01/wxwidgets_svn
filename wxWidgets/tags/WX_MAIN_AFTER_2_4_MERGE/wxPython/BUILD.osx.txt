Building wxPython on Mac OS X
-----------------------------

NOTE:  OS X support is HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL at this time.  Most things
       are working now, but a few still don't.  I know about most of
       them and am addressing them as I have time.  If you have any
       ideas about a fix for the stuff that's still broken then
       please persue them and send the fixes to me.


These are the steps I have used for building wxPython on Mac OS X 10.1
with the Apple Developer Tools, a.k.a the Darwin version.  I assume
that you know your way around a command line and that you know how to
get things from various CVS repositories as needed.


1. Python 2.2 is required.  There is a disk image with an installer
   package in the wxPython Sourceforge download area, in this group:

   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10718&release_id=84730

   If, for some reason you need to build your own Python, get the
   source from www.python.org and follow theinstructions in the
   Mac/OSX/README file to build and install Python.app and the
   Python.framework.

   If you build your own Python then you may want to make a symlink or
   two in /usr/local/bin so that this version of Python can be found
   from the command line.  For example:

        cd /usr/local/bin
	sudo ln -s /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.2/bin/python2.2 python2.2
        sudo ln -s python2.2 python

   Also, if you create a /usr/local/bin/pythonw script like the
   following then you can run Python GUI apps (like wxPython) directly
   from the command line:

       #!/bin/sh
       exec /Applications/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/python $@

   Be sure to give this script execute permissions:

       sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/pythonw

   If you would like to make a MachoPython installer from what you
   built then you may want to look at the scripts I use to do it
   located in wxPython/distrib/mac/buildPython.

   One last thing, make sure that /usr/local/bin is in your PATH
   environment variable.


2. In a wxWindows CVS tree make a build directory.

	cd ~/proj/wxWindows	# or wherever you put it
	mkdir build

3. Run configure from that build directory.

        cd build
	../configure --with-mac --with-opengl --enable-debug

4. Make and install wxMac.

	make
	sudo make install

5. Build and install wxPython.

	cd ../wxPython
	python setup.py IN_CVS_TREE=1 build install

6. Test.  Just navigate in the Finder to the demo directory and double
   click demo.py, or simple.py, or whatever you want to run.  Or from
   a command line you can run it this way:

	cd demo
	pythonw demo.py

7. Figure out what's wrong, figure out how to fix it, and then send
   the patches to me.  <wink>
