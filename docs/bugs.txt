wxWindows Buglist
-----------------

wxGTK:

wxMSW:

wxMotif:

- wxNotebook and property list frame do not appear properly when
  first shown.
  Workaround: resize the window (manually or programmatically) to
  make the window appear.
  This also happens with other windows, e.g. the sizer
  dialog in the layout sample.

- wxSashWindow borders aren't repainted properly if the sashtest
  sample is exposed (after being under another window).

- If a popup wxMenu is destroyed after its parent window has been
  destroyed, we get the message "Object XXX does not have windowed
  ancestor".
  Workaround: delete the menu before deleting the window on which it
  was popped up.
  Possible fix: call menu->DestroyMenu() before deleting the window,
  if the window knows about the menu that was last popped up (hard
  to know this with confidence).

- In wxGrid, cell highlight is not drawn/erased properly.

- Setting the size of a hidden window may show that window.
