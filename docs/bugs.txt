BUG NUMBER:             1
SHORT DESCRIPTION:      Popup menu bug
DETAILS:
If a popup wxMenu is destroyed after its parent window has been
destroyed, we get the message "Object XXX does not have windowed
ancestor".
Possible fix: call menu->DestroyMenu() before deleting the window,
if the window knows about the menu that was last popped up (hard
to know this with confidence).
WORKAROUND:
Delete the menu before deleting the window on which it
was popped up.

BUG NUMBER:             2
SHORT DESCRIPTION:      Misc. Motif bugs
DETAILS:
- In wxGrid, cell highlight is not drawn/erased properly.

- Setting the size of a hidden window may show that window.

- wxRadioBox sometimes doesn't show (e.g. in controls sample).

- Can't set the colours for the buttons in the file selector, for
  some reason.

- On SGI IRIX 6.4, XtDestroyWidget in ~wxWindow causes a crash in
  some cicumstances. This is being looked into. Meanwhile, a
  possible workaround is to remove the final XtDestroyWidget line in ~wxWindow
  (window.cpp). This will mean that child windows will only get
  destroyed when frames and dialogs are destroyed, so dynamic subwindow
  deletion may not work properly.

- There are reports that scrolling can cause crashes under Lesstif.
  This is probably a Lesstif bug.

BUG NUMBER:             3
SHORT DESCRIPTION:      Dialog Editor issues
DETAILS:
Dialog Editor could be more user-friendly. Controls are hard to
size and position accurately. No way of changing tab order
except by editing .wxr file.

BUG NUMBER:             4
SHORT DESCRIPTION: Appending a menuitem with negative id causes menu not to be shown
DETAILS: I haven't tested it throughly, though it happens when appending a submenu
WORKAROUND: Add dummy id number even for menuitems which don't require them (submenus for example)

BUG NUMBER:             5
SHORT DESCRIPTION: no vertical space inside wxHTML
DETAILS: We are working on making a demonstration of projects we do here
using Python & wxWindows & HTML (wxPython/wxHTML thus). We 'd like to
have the opportunity to specify vertical space, eg <br><br>, or <p><p>
in HTML. These constructs currently do not work. I looked in the source
code (nice job btw), but am not sure where to hack the solution. I
am willing to discuss this in more detail. 
WORKAROUND: Create a transparent gif of 1x1 pixel and use width & height
to fool the renderer
