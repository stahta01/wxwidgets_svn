-------------------- High priority ---------------------

DnD
  -> Must be rewritten for GTK+ 1.2
 
-------------------- Medium priority ---------------------

Show accelerator control labels and actually implement them
  -> Changed in GTK 1.2 (so let's do it for 1.2). Difficult.
  
-------------------- Low priority ---------------------
    
Right aligned checkboxes: focus highlighting is wrong, tooltips can't be set

OwnerDraw for wxListCtrl and others
  -> Postponed.
  
Implement wxPalette
  -> I never understood that. Postponed.
  
Implement different visuals and displays
  -> I never understood that. Postponed.
  
Cooperation with Qt
  -> Would be nice.
