Fix crash in DnD reported from Mahogany.

-------------------- Medium priority ---------------------

wxBitmapButton doesn't refresh when parent gets refreshed.
  -> Not important.

Show accelerator control labels and actually implement them
  -> Difficult.

Right aligned checkboxes: focus highlighting is wrong, tooltips can't be set can't be set

Port to GTK 2.0 - including its Unicode support.

Add wxNoteBook::GetPageIndex()
Add wxNoteBook::SetTabPosition()
  -> Postponed.

Implement wxPalette
  -> Postponed.
 
Implement different visuals and displays
