List of classes which should use their native GTK+ equivalents but don't:

- wxStatusBar:
    Problem with multiple fields, GtkStatusbar only seems to support one pane

- wxTreeCtrl
- wxListCtrl
    Could be reimplemeted in terms of wxDataViewCtrl?

- wxSplitterWindow

- wxDatePickerCtrl
- wxCalendarCtrl
    Use GtkCalendar

- wxWizard
    Can GtkAssistant be used?
