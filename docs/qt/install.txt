wxWidgets for Qt installation
-----------------------------

IMPORTANT NOTE:

  If you experience problems installing, please re-read these
  instructions and other related files (todo.txt, bugs.txt and
  osname.txt for your platform if it exists) carefully before
  mailing wxwin-users or the author. Preferably, try to fix the
  problem first and then send a patch to the author.

  When sending bug reports tell us what version of wxWidgets you are
  using (including the beta) and what compiler on what system. One
  example: wxQt 3.1.0, GCC 4.8.1, Ubuntu 14.04

* The simplest case
-------------------

If you compile wxWidgets on Linux for the first time and don't like to read
install instructions just do (in the base dir):

> mkdir buildqt
> cd buildqt
> ../configure --with-qt
> make
> su <type root password>
> make install
> ldconfig
[if you get "ldconfig: command not found", try using "/sbin/ldconfig"]

If you don't do the 'make install' part, you can still use the libraries from
the buildgtk directory, but they may not be available to other users.

If you want to remove wxWidgets on Unix you can do this:

> su <type root password>
> make uninstall
> ldconfig

* The simplest errors
---------------------

For any configure errors: please look at config.log file which was generated
during configure run, it usually contains some useful information.

configure reports, that you don't have Qt  installed although you are very 
sure you have. Well, you have installed it, but you also have another
version of the Qt installed, which you may need to remove. Or maybe you 
installed it in a non-default location and configure can't find it there, 
so please check that your PATH variable includes the path to the correct 
qtconfig/pkg-config. Also check that your LD_LIBRARY_PATH or equivalent 
variable contains the path to Qt libraries if they were installed in a 
non-default location.

* The simplest program
----------------------

Now create your super-application myfoo.cpp and compile anywhere with

g++ myfoo.cpp `wx-config --libs --cxxflags` -o myfoo

* GUI libraries
---------------

wxWidgets/Qt requires the Qt library to be installed on your system. It has
to be a stable version, preferably Qt 5.x.y, where x is an even number.

* Building wxGTK on Ubuntu
--------------------------

* Building wxGTK on Android
---------------------------


* Create your configuration
---------------------------

Usage:
    ./configure options

If you want to use system's C and C++ compiler,
set environment variables CC and CXX as

    % setenv CC cc
    % setenv CXX CC
    % ./configure [options]

to see all the options please use:

    ./configure --help

It is recommended to build wxWidgets in another directory (maybe a
subdirectory of your wxWidgets installation) as this allows you to
have multiple configurations (for example, debug and release or GTK
and Motif) simultaneously.

* Feature Options
-----------------

When producing an executable that is linked statically with wxQt
you'll be surprised at its immense size. This can sometimes be
drastically reduced by removing features from wxWidgets that
are not used in your program. 

Please see the output of "./configure --help" for comprehensive list
of all configurable options.

Apart from disabling certain features you can very often "strip"
the program of its debugging information resulting in a significant
reduction in size.

In the hope that it will be useful,
