Current issues and bugs
-----------------------

Owner-draw menus
----------------

If USE_OWNER_DRAWN = 1 and you create a wxMenu, you get 'all bets
are off' memory checking warnings from wxWindows.

Memory-checking subsystem
-------------------------

This conflicts with wxUSE_IOSTREAMSH = 0 using MS VC++ 5.0
(crashes the template code). It should be switched off if you
wish to use wxUSE_IOSTREAMSH = 0.
