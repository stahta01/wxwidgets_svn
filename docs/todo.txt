General ToDo
------------

- Suggestion from Janos Vegh: the memory-checking classes could
  also keep return the size of memory currently allocated, with
  a call to return it e.g. int wxDebugContext::GetMemoryUsed().
  Maybe even an optional window in debug mode with a tally of memory
  usage, how many classes of each kind are in use, etc.? That
  would be neat.

- Documentation: mention include files with each class.

- Document wxTime.

- Get Karsten to remove trashed CVS files:

  include/wx/msw/magnif1.cur
  src/msw/ctl3d/*

  and re-add them.

- wxDB ODBC classes: it seems that there are too many
  Sybase-specific features for it to work on e.g. MySQL,
  PostgreSQL. Find out what Remstar uses and document
  problems/restrictions.

- Complete this ToDo list :-)
