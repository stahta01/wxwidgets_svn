General ToDo
------------

- Suggestion from Janos Vegh: the memory-checking classes could
  also keep return the size of memory currently allocated, with
  a call to return it e.g. int wxDebugContext::GetMemoryUsed().
  Maybe even an optional window in debug mode with a tally of memory
  usage, how many classes of each kind are in use, etc.? That
  would be neat.

- Documentation: mention include files with each class.

- Get Karsten to remove trashed CVS files:

  utils/glcanvas/isosurf/isosurf.dat.gz
  src/msw/ctl3d/*

  and re-add them.

- Complete this ToDo list :-)
