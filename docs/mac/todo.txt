Bugs/Defects (GD)
-----------------
* Correct listbox creation which is causing the following error message
  under Mac OS X:

  ./Controls/Source/ControlAllocation.cp:755: failed assertion `theErr == noErr'
  Abort

  This is due to the constant kwxMacListWithVerticalScrollbar at line 40 of
  src/mac/listbox.cpp because the custom control definition has not been loaded
  and is not present in memory, see:
  
  http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn2003.html#CustomCode

* Implement toggle buttons missing under Mac OS & Mac OS X
