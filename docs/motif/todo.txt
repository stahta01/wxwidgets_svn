wxMotif TODO
------------

Updated: 16/10/98

         -------------------------------o-------------------------

High Priority
-------------

- wxScreenDC

- Extra wxBitmap formats. What about XPMs, can we assume
  libxpm exists and use that?

- Work out why XFreeFont in font.cpp produces a segv. This is
  currently commented out, which presumably causes a memory leak.

- Also work out why wxWindow::SetFont causes the widget to be shrunk
  to fit its text.

- Bitmap versions of widgets (wxBitmapButton etc.)

- wxRadioBox

- wxRadioButton

- wxComboBox: use combobox.c code as bundled in wxWin 1.68

- wxGauge: use xmgauge as per wxWin 1.68

- wxSpinButton

- wxSlider

- wxTextCtrl text file loading and saving.

- A generic version of wxNotebook that can be used in wxMotif and
  other toolkits that don't have a native control. Perhaps use wxTab as a
  starting point.

- MDI classes: use existing Motif widgets for this.

- Dialogs e.g. wxFileSelector.
  Some others need tidying, such as the colour and font selectors.

- Use generic wxTreeCtrl, wxListCtrl: enhance these.

- Write a better generic wxToolBar class than wxToolBarSimple.
  Alternatively, write a toolbar using Motif as described here:
  http://www.motifzone.com/tmd/articles/Kurt_Huhner/jun96.html.
  This article also explains how to implement tooltips.

- Colour and font setting in widgets.

- wxSystemSettings

- wxTimer

- wxThread (hopefully, similar to wxGTK)

- Write makefiles for all samples.

- Create some samples for testing.

Low Priority
------------

- Print/preview framework in print.cpp (see wxGTK).

- Enhance event handling such that you override e.g. left-click
  and unless you call the base OnMouseEvent, the click won't be
  sent to the button. Required for Dialog Editor.

- Get Dialog Editor working under Motif.

- New wxHelp version: try using the XmHTML widget at
  http://www.xs4all.nl/~ripley/XmHTML/

- Optimize screen refresh for non-native widgets, e.g. wxWindow
  created with Create(), using technique in flicker patch for 1.68
  (see JACS for latest patch).

- Copy and paste, drag and drop. Use a standard X drag
  and drop standard - see http://www.cco.caltech.edu/~jafl/xdnd/
  or use Motif drag and drop as described here:
  http://www.motifzone.com/tmd/articles/DnD/dnd.html

- Optimize colour management so we don't get clashes when e.g.
  Netscape is running. See:
  http://www.motifzone.com/tmd/articles/John_Cwikla/index.html

- wxCheckBoxList

- Write generic wxDirDialog (directory selector).

- Use native Motif dialogs for wxMessageBox.

- Miscellaneous classes e.g. wxJoystick (identical to GTK's one for
  Linux)
