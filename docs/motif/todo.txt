wxMotif TODO
------------

Updated: 21/9/98

         -------------------------------o-------------------------

- wxDCs

- wxBitmap, wxIcon, wxCursor, wxPalette. What about XPMs, can we assume
  libxpm exists and use that? What about PNGs? Can we use gdk
  as per wxGTK? Probably not.

- Work out why XFreeFont in font.cpp produces a segv. This is
  currently commented out, which presumably causes a memory leak.

- wxRegion

- Bitmap versions of widgets (wxBitmapButton etc.)

- wxCheckBoxList

- Remaining common widgets (wxListBox, wxRadioBox, wxRadioButton, wxChoice,
  wxGauge, wxComboBox etc.). Use combobox.c code as bundled in wxWin 1.68.

- wxTextCtrl text file loading and saving.

- Scrolling in wxWindow.

- A generic version of wxNotebook that can be used in wxMotif and
  other toolkits that don't have a native control. Perhaps use wxTab as a
  starting point.

- MDI classes: use existing Motif widgets for this.

- Miscellaneous classes e.g. wxJoystick (identical to GTK's one for
  Linux)

- Dialogs e.g. wxFileSelector. Use a native Motif wxMessageBox.
  Some others need tidying, such as the colour and font selectors.

- Write generic wxDirDialog (directory selector).

- Use generic wxTreeCtrl, wxListCtrl: enhance these.

- Write a better generic wxToolBar class than wxToolBarSimple.
  Alternatively, write a toolbar using Motif as described here:
  http://www.motifzone.com/tmd/articles/Kurt_Huhner/jun96.html.
  This article also explains how to implement tooltips.

- Optimize colour management so we don't get clashes when e.g.
  Netscape is running.

- Print/preview framework in print.cpp (see wxGTK's).

- Colour and font setting in widgets.

- wxSystemSettings

- wxTimer

- wxThread (hopefully, similar to wxGTK)

- Copy and paste, drag and drop. Use a standard X drag
  and drop standard - see http://www.cco.caltech.edu/~jafl/xdnd/
  or use Motif drag and drop as described here:
  http://www.motifzone.com/tmd/articles/DnD/dnd.html

- Optimize screen refresh for non-native widgets, e.g. wxWindow
  created with Create(), using technique in flicker patch for 1.68
  (see JACS for latest patch).

- Enhance event handling such that you override e.g. left-click
  and unless you call the base OnMouseEvent, the click won't be
  sent to the button. Required for Dialog Editor.

- Write makefiles for all samples.

- Create some samples for testing.

- Get Dialog Editor working under Motif.

- New wxHelp version: try using the XmHTML widget at
  http://www.xs4all.nl/~ripley/XmHTML/
