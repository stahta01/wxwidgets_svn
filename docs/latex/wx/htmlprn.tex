\membersection{HTML Printing}\label{printing}

The wxHTML library provides printing facilities with several levels of complexity. 

The easiest way to print an HTML document is to use 
\helpref{wxHtmlEasyPrinting class}{wxhtmleasyprinting}. It lets you print HTML documents with only one 
command and you don't have to care about wxPrintouts etc. at all. It is only simple wrapper around 
\helpref{wxHtmlPrintout}{wxhtmlprintout}, normal wxWindows printout class.


And finally there is low level class \helpref{wxHtmlDCRenderer}{wxhtmldcrenderer} which you can use to 
render HTML into rectangular area on any DC. It supports rendering into multiple rectangles with same 
width. (Most common use is placing one rectangle on each page or printing into two columns.)
