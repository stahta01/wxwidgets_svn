\section{wxGTK port}\label{wxgtkport}

wxGTK is a port of wxWidgets using the GTK+ library available
from www.gtk.org. It makes use of GTK+'s native widgets wherever
possible and uses wxWidgets' generic controls when needed. GTK+
itself has been ported to a number of systems, but so far only the
original X11 version is supported. All work is not being done on
GTK+ version 2.0 and above. Support for the GTK+ 1.2 branch will
be deprecated in lates releases.

You will need GTK+ 2.0 or higher which is available from:

\urlref{http://www.gtk.org}{http://www.gtk.org}

In order to configure wxWidgets to compile wxGTK you will 
need to type:

\begin{verbatim}
  configure --with-gtk
\end{verbatim}

For further information, please see the files in docs/gtk
in the distribution.
