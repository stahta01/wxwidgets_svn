\section{\class{wxStackWalker}}\label{wxstackwalker}

wxStackWalker allows to enumerate, or walk, the stack frames or, in other
words, the functions callstack. It is mostly useful in only two situations:
inside \helpref{wxApp::OnFatalException}{wxapponfatalexception} function to
programmatically get the location of the crash and, in debug builds, in 
\helpref{wxApp::OnAssert}{wxapponassert} to report the caller of the failed
assert.

wxStackWalker works by repeatedly calling 
\helpref{OnStackFrame}{wxstackwalkeronstackframe} method for each frame in the
stack, so to use it you must derive your own class from it and override this
method.

This class will not return anything except raw stack frame addresses if the
debug information is not available. See 
\helpref{debugging overview}{debuggingoverview} for how to make it available.

Only available if \texttt{wxUSE\_STACKWALKER} is $1$, currently only
implemented for Win32 and Unix versions using recent version of GNU libc.

\latexignore{\rtfignore{\wxheading{Members}}}


\membersection{wxStackWalker::wxStackWalker}\label{wxstackwalkerwxstackwalker}

\func{}{wxStackWalker}{\void}

Constructor does nothing, use \helpref{Walk()}{wxstackwalkerwalk} to walk the
stack.


\membersection{wxStackWalker::\destruct{wxStackWalker}}\label{wxstackwalkerdtor}

\func{}{\destruct{wxStackWalker}}{\void}

Destructor does nothing neither but should be virtual as this class is used as
a base one.


\membersection{wxStackWalker::OnStackFrame}\label{wxstackwalkeronstackframe}

\func{void}{OnStackFrame}{\param{const wxStackFrame\& }{frame}}

This function must be overrided to process the given frame.


\membersection{wxStackWalker::Walk}\label{wxstackwalkerwalk}

\func{void}{Walk}{\param{size\_t }{skip = 1}}

Enumerate stack frames from the current location, skipping the initial
number of them (this can be useful when Walk() is called from some known
location and you don't want to see the first few frames anyhow; also
notice that Walk() frame itself is not included if skip $\ge 1$).


\membersection{wxStackWalker::WalkFromException}\label{wxstackwalkerwalkfromexception}

\func{void}{WalkFromException}{\void}

Enumerate stack frames from the location of uncaught exception.
This method can only be called from 
\helpref{wxApp::OnFatalException()}{wxapponfatalexception}.
