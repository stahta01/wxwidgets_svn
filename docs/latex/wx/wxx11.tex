\section{wxX11 port}\label{wxx11port}

wxX11 is a port of wxWindows using X11 (The X Window System)
as the underlying graphics backend. wxX11 draws its widgets
using the wxUniversal widget set which is now part of wxWindows.
wxX11 should be well-suited for a number of special apps such
as apps running on systems with little resource (PDAs) or apps
which need to acquire a special themed look. You will need
wxWindows 2.3.2 or higher.
  
In order to configure wxWindows to compile wxX11 you will 
need to type

  configure --with-x11 --with-universal
