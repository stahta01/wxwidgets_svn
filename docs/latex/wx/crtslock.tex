\section{\class{wxCriticalSectionLocker}}\label{wxcriticalsectionlocker}

This is a small helper class to be used with \helpref{wxCriticalSection}{wxcriticalsection} 
objects. A wxCriticalSectionLocker enters the critical section in the
constructor and leaves it in the destructor making it much more difficult to
forget to leave a critical section (which, in general, will lead to serious
and difficult to debug problems).
