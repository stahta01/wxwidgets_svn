\section{\class{wxTreeItemData}}\label{wxtreeitemdata}

wxTreeItemData is some (arbitrary) user class associated with some item. The
main advantage of having this class (compared to the old untyped interface) is
that wxTreeItemData's are destroyed automatically by the tree and, as this
class has virtual dtor, it means that the memory will be automatically
freed. We don't just use wxObject instead of wxTreeItemData because
the size of this class is critical: in any real application, each tree leaf
will have wxTreeItemData associated with it and number of leaves may be
quite big.

Because the objects of this class are deleted by the tree, they should
always be allocated on the heap.

\membersection{wxTreeItemData::wxTreeItemData}\label{wxtreeitemdataconstr}

\func{}{wxTreeItemData}{\void}

Default constructor.

\pythonnote{The wxPython version of this constructor optionally
accepts any Python object as a parameter.  This object is then
associated with the tree item using the wxTreeItemData as a
container.

In addition, the following methods are added in wxPython for accessing
the object:

\indented{2cm}{\begin{twocollist}\itemsep=0pt
\twocolitem{{\bf GetData()}}{Returns a reference to the Python Object}
\twocolitem{{\bf SetData(obj)}}{Associates a new Python Object with the
wxTreeItemData}
\end{twocollist}}
}

\perlnote{In wxPerl the constructor accepts as parameter an optional scalar,
 and stores it as client data. You may retrieve this data by calling
 {\bf GetData()}, and set it by callling {\bf SetData( data ).}
}

\membersection{wxTreeItemData::\destruct{wxTreeItemData}}

\func{void}{\destruct{wxTreeItemData}}{\void}

Virtual destructor.

\membersection{wxTreeItemData::GetId}\label{wxtreeitemdatagetid}

\func{const wxTreeItem\&}{GetId}{\void}

Returns the item associated with this node.

\membersection{wxTreeItemData::SetId}\label{wxtreeitemdatasetid}

\func{void}{SetId}{\param{const wxTreeItemId\&}{ id}}

Sets the item associated with this node.
