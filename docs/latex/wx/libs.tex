wxWidgets can be built either as a single large
library (this is called the {\it monolithic build}) or as several smaller
libraries ({\it multilib build}). Multilib build is the default.

wxWidgets library is divided into libraries briefly described below. This
diagram show dependencies between them:

\begin{center}

\end{center}

{\large {\bf wxBase}}

Every wxWidgets application must link against this library. It contains
mandatory classes that any wxWidgets code depends on (e.g.
 \helpref{wxString}{wxstring}) and portability classes that abstract
differences between platforms. wxBase can be used to develop console mode
applications, it does not require any GUI libraries or running X Window System
on Unix.

{\large {\bf wxCore}}

Basic GUI classes such as GDI classes or controls are in this library. All
wxWidgets GUI applications must link against this library, only console mode
applications don't.

{\large {\bf wxAui}}

This contains the Advanced User Interface docking library.

Requires wxHTML, wxAdvanced, wxCore, wxBase, wxXML.

{\large {\bf wxNet}}

Classes for network access:

\begin{itemize}
\item{ wxSocket classes (\helpref{wxSocketClient}{wxsocketclient},
 \helpref{wxSocketServer}{wxsocketserver} and related classes) }
\item{ \helpref{wxSocketOutputStream}{wxsocketoutputstream} and
 \helpref{wxSocketInputStream}{wxsocketinputstream} }
\item{ sockets-based IPC classes (\helpref{wxTCPServer}{wxddeserver},
 \helpref{wxTCPClient}{wxddeclient} and
 \helpref{wxTCPConnection}{wxddeconnection}) }
\item{ \helpref{wxURL}{wxurl} }
\item{ wxInternetFSHandler (a \helpref{wxFileSystem handler}{fs}) }
\end{itemize}

Requires wxBase.

{\large {\bf wxRichText}}

This contains generic rich text control functionality.

Requires wxAdvanced, wxHTML, wxCore, wxXML, wxBase.

{\large {\bf wxXML}}

This library contains simple classes for parsing XML documents.

Requires wxBase.

{\large {\bf wxAdvanced}}

Advanced or rarely used GUI classes:

\begin{itemize}\itemsep=0pt
\item{ \helpref{wxBufferedDC}{wxbuffereddc} }
\item{ \helpref{wxCalendarCtrl}{wxcalendarctrl} }
\item{ \helpref{wxGrid classes}{gridoverview} }
\item{ \helpref{wxJoystick}{wxjoystick} }
\item{ \helpref{wxLayoutAlgorithm}{wxlayoutalgorithm} }
\item{ \helpref{wxSplashScreen}{wxsplashscreen} }
\item{ \helpref{wxTaskBarIcon}{wxtaskbaricon} }
\item{ \helpref{wxSound}{wxsound} }
\item{ \helpref{wxWizard}{wxwizard} }
\item{ \helpref{wxSashLayoutWindow}{wxsashlayoutwindow} }
\item{ \helpref{wxSashWindow}{wxsashwindow} }
\item{ ...others }
\end{itemize}

Requires wxCore and wxBase.

{\large {\bf wxMedia}}

Miscellaneous classes related to multimedia. Currently this library only
contains \helpref{wxMediaCtrl}{wxmediactrl} but more classes will be added in
the future.

Requires wxCore and wxBase.

{\large {\bf wxGL}}

This library contains \helpref{wxGLCanvas}{wxglcanvas} class for integrating
OpenGL library with wxWidgets. Unlike all others, this library is {\em not}
 part of the monolithic library, it is always built as separate library.

Requires wxCore and wxBase.

{\large {\bf wxHTML}}

Simple HTML renderer and other \helpref{HTML rendering classes}{wxhtml} are
contained in this library, as well as
 \helpref{wxHtmlHelpController}{wxhtmlhelpcontroller},
 \helpref{wxBestHelpController}{wxhelpcontroller} and
 \helpref{wxHtmlListBox}{wxhtmllistbox}.

Requires wxCore and wxBase.

{\large {\bf wxODBC}}

\helpref{Database classes}{odbcoverview}. Requires wxBase.

{\large {\bf wxQA}}

This is the library containing extra classes for quality assurance. Currently
it only contains \helpref{wxDebugReport}{wxdebugreport} and related classes,
but more will be added to it in the future.

Requires wxCore, wxBase and wxXML.

{\large {\bf wxDbGrid}}

\helpref{wxDbGridTableBase}{wxdbgridtablebase} class which combines 
 \helpref{wxGrid}{wxgrid} and \helpref{wxDbTable}{wxdbtable}. 

Requires wxODBC and wxAdvanced.

{\large {\bf wxXRC}}

This library contains \helpref{wxXmlResource}{wxxmlresource} class that
provides access to XML resource files in XRC format

Requires wxXML, wxCore, wxAdvanced and wxHTML.

{\large {\bf wxSTC}}

STC (Styled Text Control) is a wrapper around Scintilla, a syntax-highlighting text editor.

Requires wxCore, wxBase.
