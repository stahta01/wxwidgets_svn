Installing wxBase 2.2
---------------------

This is wxBase 2.2 for Microsoft Windows 9x/NT/2000 and generic Unix
platforms. wxBase is a collection of non GUI classes, functions and macros
used by wxWindows framework.

It contains several data structure classes (as wxWindows predates STL, it has
its own string, list, array, hash table, ... classes and also a powerful
wxDateTime class), OS-abstraction classes (wxThread, wxSocket, wxStopWatch &c)
and a few more utility classes (wxCmdLineParser, wxConfig for working with
.INI and other configuration files, wxDllLoader for run-time binding and much
more).

Compilation
-----------

a) under Win32 with Visual C++: open the provided wxBase.dsw workspace. From
   it, you can build wxBase as a static library and/or as a DLL. Please see

            http://www.wxwindows.org/vadim/wxDocs/buildmsw.html

   for the instructions on how to use wxBase in your own projects. You can
   also download the precompiled binaries from

            http://www.wxwindows.org/vadim/wxDocs/binaries.html

   NB: it should be possible to compile wxBase with other compilers as well,
       if you managed to do this, please let me know so that your makefiles
       could be included in the next distribution.

b) under Unix/BeOS: use configure with --disab;e-gui argument. Building wxBase
   in a separate directory is recommended, i.e.:

        $ gunzip -c wxBase-x.y.z.tar.gz | tar xvf -
        $ cd wxBase-x.y.z

        # assuming you want to build the debug version of the library
        $ mkdir debug
        $ cd debug
        $ ../configure --disable-gui --enable-debug

        # if you want to build the release version:
        $ mkdir release
        $ cd release
        $ ../configure --disable-gui

        # in both cases
        $ make && make install

    Under most modern Unices you can specify --disable-static option to
configure to avoid building the static libraries (but only the shared ones) to
save some time and disk space.

Problems
--------

If you encounter problems or bugs, please report them to
wx-users@wxwindows.org mailing list. Be sure to mention your platform, wxBase
version and the compiler information. Thanks!
