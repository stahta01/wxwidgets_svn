C++ Features
============

- Namespaces
- STL containers compatibility
- Exception Handling

Core
====

- use wxEventLoop in all builds
- remove wxCOMPATIBILITY (1.X)
- Modularization/Build System/Project File Generation
- RTTI native Support, Properties/Member-Metadata, 2-Step Init with virtual create

Documentation
=============

- Possibilities moving doc into header files with tool support ? directions ?
- wxDC : Precise definition of default/initial state. 
- wxDC : Pixelwise definition of operations.

wxEvents
========

Change Idle Handling
--------------------
Current Implementation is using too many CPU cycles

Loose Coupling Event-Source Event-Sink
--------------------------------------
kind of the NextStep/C# very performant coupling, exposing events via Metadata

Remove Lazy Init of Eventtables
-------------------------------
Was introduced as a bug-fix, not needed anymore, consumes considerably CPU


Modules/Plugins
===============

Architecture
------------

we aim to arrive at a lazy initializiation of modules only when they are first 
needed. A dependency information about on which other modules this depends is 
needed. Dynamic Plug-In loading and unloading must be compatible with that.

wxUniversal
===========

- Renderers within native ports

wxPrinting
==========

- Page preflighting capabilities in order to determine number of pages
- Preview enhancement

wxStaticBox
===========

hide the platform problems (GTK:'children' must be siblings) in encapsulation 
in order to avoid problems on ports where the hierarchy must be 'correct'

wxMiscellaneous
===============

- wxDC Support for point to char-position with text rendering
- wxLocale Extension (eg Currency)
- wxStreams review
