Publicity notes and ideas
=========================

Release announcments can be made to the following
newsgroups.

Microsoft:

comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc
comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools
comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools.mfc
comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools.misc
comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32
comp.windows.ms.programmer
microsoft.public.win32.programmer.tools
microsoft.public.win32.programmer.ui

Non-Microsoft:

comp.programming
comp.os.linux.development.apps
comp.os.linux.announce
comp.sys.mac.programmer.tools
comp.software-eng
comp.lang.c++

comp.windows.x
comp.windows.x.announce
comp.windows.x.motif

Note: submissions to comp.windows.linux.announce must be
sent to cola@stump.algebra.com, with short descr
of software and location. See http://stump.algebra.com/~cola/
NO CROSSPOSTING when sending to this address.

Pack plenty information into the subject. 
Don't write a subject like "Foo version 1.1 released". Many
people will not know what Foo is, so the subject won't help them
select articles. Instead, say "Foo 1.1 - copy files more
efficiently than cp". There is no need to say that the article
is an announcement, so don't write a subject like "ANNOUNCEMENT:
Foo version 1.1 released".
