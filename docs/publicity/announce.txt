*** About wxWidgets

wxWidgets is a comprehensive open-source, multi-platform C++ GUI
framework, that can be used to build commercial and free software.
First released in 1992 under the name wxWindows, it's increasingly
used by organisations and individuals all over the world due to its
winning combination of sophistication, wide platform coverage, ease
of use, unrestrictive licence and vibrant user community.

For most ports, wxWidgets adopts the native look and feel of each
platform since it uses the native widget sets. There is also a generic
widget set, used for example by the wxX11 port - no other widget set
is required, giving the potential for embedded use.

An extraordinary range of classes is provided - but don't be put off
by this because most people find wxWidgets easier to learn and use than
MFC and other frameworks.

As well as comprehensive support for the usual widgets, advanced
features include: HTML viewing/printing, wxImage class providing
handlers for reading and writing many image types, resizeable panels
and dialogs on all platforms, document/view, OpenGL support,
HTML-based and context-sensitive help, wizards, drag and drop, a grid
class, ODBC support, threads, sockets, container classes, a styled text
control, and much more. A 2,000-page reference manual is provided in
HTML, MS HTML Help, WinHelp, wxWidgets Help and PDF formats, and there
are over eighty samples and demos.

If you're an MFC user, you'll find many wxWidgets concepts reassuringly
familiar, while often clearer and more consistent. If you're not, you
should still find it intuitive from the start.

wxWidgets bindings for several other languages are available, including
Python, Perl, Basic, Lua, JavaScript and Eiffel.

Have fun!
