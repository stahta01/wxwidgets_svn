<h3>What is wxWindows 2 for GTK?</h3>

wxWindows 2 for GTK is a port of wxWindows to the <a href="http://www.gimp.org/gtk" target=_top>GTK+ toolkit</a>,
which is freely available for most flavours of Unix with X. wxWindows 2 for GTK is
often abbreviated to wxGTK. wxGTK has a separate home page <a href="http://www.freiburg.linux.de/~wxxt" target=_top>here</a>.
<P>

<h3>Does wxGTK have GNOME support?</h3>

Currently wxGTK does not have any features that would involve dependence on any desktop
environment's libraries, so it can work on GNOME, KDE and with other window managers
without installation hassles. Some GNOME and KDE integration features are file based, and
so may be added without dependence on libraries. Other features may be supported in the
future, probably as a separate library.
