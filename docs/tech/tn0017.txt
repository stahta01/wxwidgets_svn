                    How to write unit tests for wxWindows
                    =====================================

 Unit tests for wxWindows are written using small cppunit framework. To compile
(but not to run) them you need to have it installed. Hence the first part of
this note exlpains how to do it while the second one explains how to write the
test.

I. CppUnit Installation
-----------------------

1. Get it from http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit
   (latest version as of the time of this writing is 1.8.0)

2. Build the library:
 a) Under Windows using VC++ (both versions 6 and 7 work):
    - build everything in CppUnitLibraries.dsw work space
    - add include and lib subdirectories of the directory
      where you installed cppunit to the compiler search path
      using "Tools|Options" menu in VC IDEA

 b) Under Unix: run configure && make && make install as usual


II. Writing tests with CppUnit
------------------------------

1. Create a new directory tests/foo

2. Write the main.cpp file for the test program copying, if you want,
   from one of the existing tests. The things to look for:
 a) #include "wx/cppunit.h" instead of directly including CppUnit headers
 b) don't put too many things in one test case nor in one method of a test
    case as it makes understanding what exactly failed harder later

   Read CppUnit documentation for more.

3. Write a bakefile for the new test (again, copy an existing one...)
