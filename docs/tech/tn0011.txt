                 All about wxWidgets Version Numbers
                 ===================================

1. Where to update the version numbers:

   There are several places in the wxWidgets source tree that
   define the version number for the library.  When updating the
   version number all of these files must be edited:

       {wx}/configure.in
       {wx}/*.spec
       {wx}/include/wx/version.h
       {wx}/include/msvc/wx/setup.h [only major.minor used here]
       {wx}/samples/minimal/borland_ide.cpp
       {wx}/docs/latex/wx/manual.tex
       {wx}/docs/msw/install.txt {major release only}
       {wx}/docs/changes.txt
       {wx}/build/bakefiles/wxpresets/presets/wx_win32.bkl
       {wx}/build/bakefiles/version.bkl {C:R:A}
       {wx}/build/script/win_docs.bat {windows doc and setup file}
       {wx}/distrib/scripts/build-environ.cfg {SVN tar and zip files}
       {wx}/include/wx/mac/carbon/config_xcode.h

   The script misc/scripts/inc_release can be used for incrementing
   the release field of the version, i.e. changing 2.8.x to 2.8.x+1.
