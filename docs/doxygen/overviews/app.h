 @page app_overview wxApp overview
 
 Classes: #wxApp
 A wxWidgets application does not have a @e main procedure; the equivalent is the
 #OnInit member defined for a class derived from wxApp.
 @e OnInit will usually create a top window as a bare minimum.
 Unlike in earlier versions of wxWidgets, OnInit does not return a frame. Instead it
 returns a boolean value which indicates whether processing should continue (@true) or not (@false).
 You call wxApp::SetTopWindow to let wxWidgets know
 about the top window.
 Note that the program's command line arguments, represented by @e argc 
 and @e argv, are available from within wxApp member functions.
 An application closes by destroying all windows. Because all frames must
 be destroyed for the application to exit, it is advisable to use parent
 frames wherever possible when creating new frames, so that deleting the
 top level frame will automatically delete child frames. The alternative
 is to explicitly delete child frames in the top-level frame's #wxCloseEvent
 handler.
 In emergencies the #wxExit function can be called to kill the
 application however normally the application shuts down automatically, 
 @ref appshutdown_overview.
 An example of defining an application follows:
 
 @code
 class DerivedApp : public wxApp
 {
 public:
   virtual bool OnInit();
 };
 
 IMPLEMENT_APP(DerivedApp)
 
 bool DerivedApp::OnInit()
 {
   wxFrame *the_frame = new wxFrame(@NULL, ID_MYFRAME, argv[0]);
   ...
   the_frame-Show(@true);
   SetTopWindow(the_frame);
 
   return @true;
 }
 @endcode
 
 Note the use of IMPLEMENT_APP(appClass), which allows wxWidgets to dynamically create an instance of the application object
 at the appropriate point in wxWidgets initialization. Previous versions of wxWidgets used
 to rely on the creation of a global application object, but this is no longer recommended,
 because required global initialization may not have been performed at application object
 construction time.
 You can also use DECLARE_APP(appClass) in a header file to declare the wxGetApp function which returns
 a reference to the application object. Otherwise you can only use the global 
 @c wxTheApp pointer which is of type @c wxApp *.
 
 @ref appshutdown_overview
 
 
 @section wxappshutdownoverview Application shutdown
 
 The application normally shuts down when the last of its top level windows is
 closed. This is normally the expected behaviour and means that it is enough to
 call #Close() in response to the @c "Exit" menu
 command if your program has a single top level window. If this behaviour is not
 desirable wxApp::SetExitOnFrameDelete can
 be called to change it. Note that starting from wxWidgets 2.3.3 such logic
 doesn't apply for the windows shown before the program enters the main loop: in
 other words, you can safely show a dialog from 
 wxApp::OnInit and not be afraid that your application
 terminates when this dialog -- which is the last top level window for the
 moment -- is closed.
 
 Another aspect of the application shutdown is #OnExit 
 which is called when the application exits but @e before wxWidgets cleans up
 its internal structures. You should delete all wxWidgets object that you
 created by the time OnExit finishes. In particular, do @b not destroy them
 from application class' destructor!
 For example, this code may crash:
 
 @code
 class MyApp : public wxApp
 {
  public:
     wxCHMHelpController m_helpCtrl;
     ...
 };
 @endcode
 
 The reason for that is that @c m_helpCtrl is a member object and is 
 thus destroyed from MyApp destructor. But MyApp object is deleted after 
 wxWidgets structures that wxCHMHelpController depends on were 
 uninitialized! The solution is to destroy HelpCtrl in @e OnExit:
 
 @code
 class MyApp : public wxApp
 {
  public:
     wxCHMHelpController *m_helpCtrl;
     ...
 };
 
 bool MyApp::OnInit()
 {
   ...
   m_helpCtrl = new wxCHMHelpController;
   ...
 }
 
 int MyApp::OnExit()
 {
   delete m_helpCtrl;
   return 0;
 }
 @endcode
