 @page utilities_page Utilities and libraries supplied with wxWidgets

 In addition to the @ref libraries_page, some
 additional utilities are supplied in the @c utils hierarchy.

 For other user-contributed packages, please see the Contributions page
 on the wxWidgets Web site http://www.wxwidgets.org.

 @li @b Helpview: Helpview is a program for displaying wxWidgets HTML
 Help files. In many cases, you may wish to use the wxWidgets HTML
 Help classes from within your application, but this provides a
 handy stand-alone viewer. See @ref html_overview for more details.
 You can find it in @c samples/html/helpview.

 @li @b Tex2RTF; Supplied with wxWidgets is a utility called Tex2RTF for 
 converting @e LaTeX manuals HTML, MS HTML Help, wxHTML Help, RTF, and Windows
 Help RTF formats. Tex2RTF was used for the wxWidgets manuals and can be used 
 independently by authors wishing to create on-line and printed manuals from the 
 same @e LaTeX source. Please see the separate documentation for Tex2RTF.
 You can find it under @c utils/tex2rtf.

 @li @b Helpgen: Helpgen takes C++ header files and generates a Tex2RTF-compatible
 documentation file for each class it finds, using comments as appropriate.
 This is a good way to start a reference for a set of classes.
 Helpgen can be found in @c utils/HelpGen.

 @li @b Emulator: Xnest-based display emulator for X11-based PDA applications.
 On some systems, the Xnest window does not synchronise with the
 'skin' window. This program can be found in @c utils/emulator.
